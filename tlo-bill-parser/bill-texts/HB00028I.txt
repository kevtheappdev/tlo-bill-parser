| contract _; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____may not improperly classify a worker employed by_  
| _it in the execution of the contract as an independent contractor in_  
| _order to avoid paying the worker under Subdivision (1)_.  
|  (b) A contractor or subcontractor who violates this section  
| shall pay to the state or a political subdivision of the state on  
| whose behalf the contract is made _$90_ [ ~~, $60~~ ] for _:_

|  _(B)_ _____not later than the 30th day before the date_  
| _the work is scheduled to be completed on the contract; and_

| date the contract was entered into, and the former law is continued  
| in effect for that purpose.

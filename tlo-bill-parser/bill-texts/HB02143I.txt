|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the eligibility of a first responder for workers'  
| compensation benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 504.019(b), Labor Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) Post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by a first  
| responder is a compensable injury under this subtitle only if it is  
| based on a diagnosis that:  
|  (1) the disorder is caused by an event _or exposure to_  
| _multiple events_ occurring in the course and scope of the first  
| responder's employment; and  
|  (2) the preponderance of the evidence indicates that  
| the event _or exposure to multiple events_ was a substantial  
| contributing factor of the disorder.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a claim for workers' compensation benefits based on a  
| compensable injury that occurs on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.  A claim based on a compensable injury that occurs before  
| that date is governed by the law as it existed on the date the  
| compensable injury occurred, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

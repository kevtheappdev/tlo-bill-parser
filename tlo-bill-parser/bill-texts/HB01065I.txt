| _applicable residency program accreditation requirements._  
|  _(c)_ _____The board may provide grants only to support a physician_

| _grant funding._

| _will set a primary goal of producing physicians who are prepared for_  
| _practice in a rural area; and_  
|  _(5)_ _____include evidence of support for residency training_  
| _by sponsoring institutions and the community._  
|  _(f)_ _____The board shall award grants for all residency positions_  
| _awarded a grant under this section in the preceding year before_  
| _awarding a grant for a residency position that did not receive a_  
| _grant in the preceding year, provided that the applicable grant_  
| _recipient from the preceding year complies with all conditions of_  
| _the grant as described by Subsection (g) and satisfies the grant_  
| _eligibility requirements._  
|  _(g)_ _____The board shall monitor physician residency programs_  
| _receiving grants as necessary to ensure compliance with the grant_  
| _program and shall require the return of any unused grant money by,_  
| _or shall decline to award additional grants to, a residency program_  
| _that receives a grant but fails to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____create and fill, within a reasonable period, the_  
| _number of residency positions proposed in the program's grant_  
| _application; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____satisfy any other conditions of the grant imposed_  
| _by the board._  
|  _(h)_ _____The board shall use money forfeited under Subsection (g)_  
| _to award grants to other eligible applicants. With respect to the_  
| _physician residency program forfeiting the grant, the board may_  
| _restore grant money or award additional grants, as applicable, to_  
| _the program as soon as practicable after the program satisfies all_  
| _conditions of the grant._  
|  _(i)_ _____The board shall adopt rules for the administration of_  
| _the grant program. The rules must include:_  
|  _(1) administrative provisions governing:_  
|  _(A) eligibility criteria for grant applicants;_  
|  _(B) grant application procedures;_  
|  _(C) guidelines relating to grant amounts;_  
|  _(D)_ _____guidelines relating to the number of grants_  
| _to be awarded each year, subject to available funds;_  
|  _(E)_ _____procedures for evaluating grant_  
| _applications;_  
|  _(F)_ _____procedures for monitoring the use of grants;_  
| _and_  
|  _(G) reporting requirements for grant recipients;_  
|  _(2)_ _____methods for tracking the effectiveness of grants;_  
| _and_  
|  _(3)_ _____any conditions relating to the receipt and use of a_  
| _grant as considered appropriate by the board._

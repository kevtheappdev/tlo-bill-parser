| filed or to which an eminent domain case is assigned shall appoint _,_  
| _not later than the third day after the date the condemnation_  
| _petition is filed,_ three disinterested real property owners who  
| reside in the county as special commissioners to assess the damages  
| of the owner of the property being condemned. The judge appointing  
| the special commissioners shall give preference to persons agreed  
| on by the parties. The judge shall provide _the owner of the_  
| _property being condemned and the condemnor_ [ ~~each party~~ ] a  
| reasonable period _not to exceed 20 days after the date of the_  
| _appointment_ to strike one of the three commissioners appointed by  
| the judge. If a person fails to serve as a commissioner or is struck

| effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

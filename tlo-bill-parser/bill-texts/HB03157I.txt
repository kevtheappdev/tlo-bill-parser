|  SECTION 1. Section 531.001, Government Code, is amended by  
| adding Subdivision (4-c) to read as follows:  
|  _(4-c) "Medicaid managed care organization" means a_  
| _managed care organization as defined by Section 533.001 that_  
| _contracts with the commission under Chapter 533 to provide health_  
| _care services to Medicaid recipients._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 531.102, Government Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b), (f), (f-1), (h), (n), (p), and (r) and  
| adding Subsection (y) to read as follows:  
|  (b) The [ ~~commission, in consultation with the~~] inspector  
| general[ ~~,~~ ] shall set clear objectives, priorities, and performance  
| standards for the office that emphasize:  
|  (1) coordinating investigative efforts to  
| aggressively recover money;  
|  (2) allocating resources to cases that have the  
| strongest supportive evidence [ ~~and the~~ ~~~~ ~~greatest potential~~ ~~~~
~~for~~  
|  ~~recovery of~~ ~~~~ ~~money~~ ]; and  
|  (3) maximizing opportunities for referral of cases to  
| the office of the attorney general in accordance with Section  
| 531.103.  
|  (f)(1) If the commission receives a complaint or allegation  
| of Medicaid fraud or abuse from any source, the office must conduct  
| a preliminary investigation as provided by Section 531.118(c) to  
| determine whether there is a sufficient basis to warrant a full  
| investigation. A preliminary investigation must begin not later  
| than the 30th day, and be completed not later than the 45th day,  
| after the date the commission receives a complaint or allegation or  
| has reason to believe that fraud or abuse has occurred.  
|  (2) If the findings of a preliminary investigation  
| give the office reason to believe that an incident of fraud or abuse  
| involving possible criminal conduct has occurred in Medicaid, the  
| office must take the following action, as appropriate, not later  
| than the 30th day after the completion of the preliminary  
| investigation:  
|  (A) if a provider _or Medicaid managed care_  
| _organization_ is suspected of fraud or abuse involving criminal  
| conduct, the office must refer the case to the state's Medicaid  
| fraud control unit, provided that the criminal referral does not  
| preclude the office from continuing its investigation of the  
| provider _or Medicaid managed care organization_ , which  
| investigation may lead to the imposition of appropriate  
| administrative or civil sanctions; or  
|  (B) if there is reason to believe that a  
| recipient has defrauded Medicaid, the office may conduct a full  
| investigation of the suspected fraud, subject to Section  
| 531.118(c).  
|  (f-1) The office shall complete a full investigation of a  
| complaint or allegation of Medicaid fraud or abuse against a  
| provider _or Medicaid managed care organization_ not later than the  
| 180th day after the date the full investigation begins unless the  
| office determines that more time is needed to complete the  
| investigation. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if  
| the office determines that more time is needed to complete the  
| investigation, the office shall provide notice to the provider _or_  
| _Medicaid managed care organization that_ [ ~~who~~ ] is the subject of the  
| investigation stating that the length of the investigation will  
| exceed 180 days and specifying the reasons why the office was unable  
| to complete the investigation within the 180-day period. The office  
| is not required to provide notice to the provider _or Medicaid_  
| _managed care organization_ under this subsection if the office  
| determines that providing notice would jeopardize the  
| investigation.  
|  (h) In addition to performing functions and duties  
| otherwise provided by law, the office may:  
|  (1) assess administrative penalties otherwise  
| authorized by law on behalf of the commission or a health and human  
| services agency;  
|  (2) request that the attorney general obtain an  
| injunction to prevent a person from disposing of an asset  
| identified by the office as potentially subject to recovery by the  
| office due to the person's fraud or abuse;  
|  (3) provide for coordination between the office and  
| special investigative units formed by managed care organizations  
| under Section 531.113 or entities with which managed care  
| organizations contract under that section;  
|  (4) audit the use and effectiveness of state or  
| federal funds, including contract and grant funds, administered by  
| a person _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] state agency _, or managed care organization_
receiving  
| the funds from a health and human services agency;  
|  (5) conduct investigations relating to the funds  
| described by Subdivision (4); and  
|  (6) recommend policies promoting economical and  
| efficient administration of the funds described by Subdivision (4)  
| and the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in  
| administration of those funds.  
|  (n) To the extent permitted under federal law, the executive  
| commissioner, on behalf of the office, shall adopt rules  
| establishing the criteria for initiating a full-scale fraud or  
| abuse investigation, conducting the investigation, collecting  
| evidence, accepting and approving a provider's request to post a  
| surety bond to secure potential recoupments in lieu of a payment  
| hold or other asset or payment guarantee, and establishing minimum  
| training requirements for Medicaid [ ~~provider~~ ] fraud or abuse  
| investigators.  
|  (p) The executive commissioner, in consultation with the  
| office, shall adopt rules establishing criteria:  
|  (1) for opening a case;  
|  (2) for prioritizing cases for the efficient  
| management of the office's workload, including rules that direct  
| the office to prioritize:  
|  (A) provider _and managed care organization_ cases  
| according to the highest [ ~~potential for recovery or~~ ] risk to the  
| state [ ~~as indicated through the provider's volume of billings,~~ ~~~~
~~the~~  
|  ~~provider's history of~~ ~~~~ ~~noncompliance with the~~ ~~~~ ~~law, and
identified~~ ~~~~  
|  ~~fraud trends~~ ];  
|  (B) recipient cases according to the highest  
| potential for recovery and federal timeliness requirements; and  
|  (C) internal affairs investigations according to  
| the seriousness of the threat to recipient safety and the risk to  
| program integrity in terms of the amount or scope of fraud, waste,  
| and abuse posed by the allegation that is the subject of the  
| investigation; and  
|  (3) to guide field investigators in closing a case  
| that is not worth pursuing through a full investigation.  
|  (r) The office shall review the office's investigative  
| process, including the office's use of sampling and extrapolation  
| to audit provider _and managed care organization_ records. The  
| review shall be performed by staff who are not directly involved in  
| investigations conducted by the office.  
|  _(y)_ _____Based on the results of an audit, inspection, or_  
| _investigation of a managed care organization conducted by the_  
| _office under this section, the office may recommend to the_

|  SECTION 3. Sections 531.102(g)(1) and (7), Government Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:

| records are being withheld, concealed, destroyed, fabricated, or in  
| any way falsified, the office shall immediately refer the case to  
| the state's Medicaid fraud control unit.However, such criminal  
| referral does not preclude the office from continuing its  
| investigation of the provider _or Medicaid managed care_  
| _organization_ , which investigation may lead to the imposition of  
| appropriate administrative or civil sanctions.  
|  (7) The office shall, in consultation with the state's  
| Medicaid fraud control unit, establish guidelines under which  
| program exclusions:  
|  (A) may permissively be imposed on a provider _or_  
| _Medicaid managed care organization_ ; or

| _organization_ containing the date each allegation was received or  
| identified and the source of the allegation, if available. The  
| record is confidential under Section 531.1021(g) and is subject to  
| Section 531.1021(h).  
|  (b) If the commission receives an allegation of fraud or  
| abuse against a provider _or managed care organization_ from any

| a preliminary investigation of the allegation to determine whether  
| there is a sufficient basis to warrant a full investigation. A  
| preliminary investigation must begin not later than the 30th day,  
| and be completed not later than the 45th day, after the date the

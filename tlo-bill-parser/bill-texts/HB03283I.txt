|  AN ACT  
| relating to the release of certain defendants on bail.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 17, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Article 17.1501 to read as follows:  
|  _Art._ ___17.1501._ _____BAIL SCHEDULE; RELEASE OF DEFENDANT._ ___(a)_
___The_  
| _judges of the courts trying criminal cases in a county may_  
| _promulgate a standing order setting out a schedule of suggested_  
| _bail amounts for any offense over which the courts have_  
| _jurisdiction under Chapter 4._  
|  _(b)_ _____A defendant who is charged with an offense for which a_  
| _bail schedule has been established under Subsection (a) may waive_  
| _the defendant's right to appear before a magistrate under Article_  
| _15.17 and be released from custody on giving bail in the amount_  
| _required by the schedule._  
|  _(c)_ _____A defendant who is unable to give bail in the amount_  
| _required by the schedule may file with the applicable magistrate a_  
| _sworn affidavit declaring the maximum amount that the defendant_  
| _would be able to pay or provide as security within 24 hours of_  
| _arrest for purposes of obtaining a bail bond. The affidavit must_  
| _set out sufficient facts to clearly establish that amount, given_  
| _the totality of the defendant's circumstances._  
|  _(d)_ _____A defendant who files an affidavit under Subsection (c)_  
| _is entitled to a hearing before the magistrate on the bail amount._ __  
| _The hearing must be held not later than 48 hours after the charges_  
| _were filed against the defendant or 48 hours after the defendant was_  
| _arrested, whichever is later. At the hearing, the magistrate shall_  
| _consider the facts stated in the affidavit and the rules_  
| _established by Article 17.15 and set the defendant's bail._ ___The_  
| _magistrate shall issue oral or written findings of fact supporting_  
| _the decision._  
|  _(e)_ _____A defendant who has not given bail before the fourth_  
| _business day after the date bail is set under this article shall be_  
| _taken before the court before whom the case is pending for a hearing_  
| _to reconsider the bail amount. At a hearing under this subsection,_  
| _the court may adjust the bail, keep the bail as previously set, or_  
| _impose any additional conditions of release on bond the court_  
| _considers necessary._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a person who is arrested on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A person arrested before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the person was arrested,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to an exemption from ad valorem taxation by a school  
| district for maintenance and operations purposes of the total  
| appraised value of a residence homestead and the offsetting of the  
| resulting revenue loss to school districts with state sales and use  
| tax revenue.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
| ARTICLE 1. SCHOOL DISTRICT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS TAXES  
|  SECTION 1.01. Section 11.13, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (s) to read as follows:  
|  _(s)_ _____In addition to any other exemptions provided by this_  
| _section, an adult is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a_  
| _school district for maintenance and operations purposes of the_  
| _total appraised value of the adult's residence homestead._  
|  SECTION 1.02. Section 11.26, Tax Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (a-3), (b), and (e) and adding  
| Subsections (a-4) and (a-5) to read as follows:  
|  (a) The tax officials shall appraise [ ~~the~~ ] property to which  
| this section applies and calculate taxes as on other _residence_  
| _homesteads_ [ ~~property~~ ], but if the tax [ ~~so~~ ] calculated exceeds
the  
| limitation imposed by this section, the tax imposed is the amount of  
| the tax as limited by this section, except as otherwise provided by  
| this section.  A school district may not increase the total annual  
| amount of ad valorem tax it imposes on the residence homestead of an  
| individual 65 years of age or older or on the residence homestead of  
| an individual who is disabled, as defined by Section 11.13, above  
| the amount of the tax it imposed in the first tax year in which the  
| individual qualified that residence homestead for the applicable  
| exemption provided by Section 11.13(c) for an individual who is 65  
| years of age or older or is disabled.  If the individual qualified  
| that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of  
| that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for  
| the same exemption for the next year, and if the school district  
| taxes imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less  
| than the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a school  
| district may not subsequently increase the total annual amount of  
| ad valorem taxes it imposes on the residence homestead above the  
| amount it imposed in the year immediately following the first year  
| for which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the  
| same exemption, except as provided by Subsection (b).  If the first  
| tax year the individual qualified the residence homestead for the  
| exemption provided by Section 11.13(c) for individuals 65 years of  
| age or older or disabled was a tax year before the 2015 tax year, the  
| amount of the limitation provided by this section is the amount of  
| tax the school district imposed for the 2014 tax year less an amount  
| equal to the amount determined by multiplying $10,000 times the tax  
| rate of the school district for the 2015 tax year, plus any 2015 tax  
| attributable to improvements made in 2014, other than improvements  
| made to comply with governmental regulations or repairs.  
|  (a-3) Except as provided by _Subsections (a-4) and_  
| [ ~~Subsection~~ ] (b), a limitation on tax increases provided by this  
| section on a residence homestead computed under Subsection (a-1) or  
| (a-2) continues to apply to the homestead in subsequent tax years  
| until the limitation expires.  
|  _(a-4)_ _____Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section,_  
| _if in the 2020 tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on_  
| _tax increases provided by this section on the individual's_  
| _residence homestead, the amount of the limitation provided by this_  
| _section on the homestead in the 2020 tax year is equal to the amount_  
| _computed by:_  
|  _(1)_ _____multiplying the amount of tax the school district_  
| _imposed on the homestead in the 2019 tax year by a fraction the_  
| _numerator of which is the current debt rate of the district for the_  
| _2020 tax year and the denominator of which is the tax rate of the_  
| _district for the 2019 tax year; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____adding any tax imposed in the 2020 tax year_  
| _attributable to improvements made in the 2019 tax year as provided_  
| _by Subsection (b) to the lesser of the amount computed under_  
| _Subdivision (1) or the amount of tax the district imposed on the_  
| _homestead in the 2019 tax year._  
|  _(a-5)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (b), a limitation on_  
| _tax increases provided by this section on a residence homestead_  
| _computed under Subsection (a-4) continues to apply to the residence_  
| _homestead in subsequent tax years until the limitation expires._  
|  (b) If an individual makes improvements to the individual's  
| residence homestead, other than improvements required to comply  
| with governmental requirements or repairs, the school district may  
| increase the tax on the homestead in the first year the value of the  
| homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the  
| enhancement of value by the improvements. The amount of the tax  
| increase is determined by applying the current _debt_ [ ~~tax~~ ] rate to  
| the difference in the assessed value of the homestead with the  
| improvements and the assessed value it would have had without the  
| improvements. A limitation imposed by this section then applies to  
| the increased amount of tax until more improvements, if any, are  
| made.  
|  (e) For each school district in an appraisal district, the  
| chief appraiser shall determine the portion of the appraised value  
| of residence homesteads of individuals on which school district  
| taxes are not imposed in a tax year because of the limitation on tax  
| increases imposed by this section. That portion is calculated by  
| determining the taxable value that, if multiplied by the _current_  
| _debt_ [ ~~tax~~ ] rate adopted by the school district for the tax year,  
| would produce an amount equal to the amount of tax that would have  
| been imposed by the school district on those residence homesteads  
| if the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section were not  
| in effect, but that was not imposed because of that limitation. The  
| chief appraiser shall determine that taxable value and certify it  
| to the comptroller as soon as practicable for each tax year.  
|  SECTION 1.03. Section 26.09, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (f) to read as follows:  
|  _(f)_ _____For purposes of calculating the tax imposed on the_  
| _residence homestead of an adult by a school district, the tax rate_  
| _of the district is considered to be the district's current debt_  
| _rate._  
|  SECTION 1.04. This article applies only to ad valorem taxes  
| imposed for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the system by which an application for a low income  
| housing tax credit is scored.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2306.6710(f), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (f) In evaluating the level of community support for an  
| application under Subsection (b)(1)(J), the department shall  
| award:  
|  (1) positive points for positive written statements  
| received _, unless a resolution is voted on and approved in support of_  
| _the application under Subsection (b)(1)(B)_ ;  
|  (2) negative points for negative written statements  
| received; and  
|  (3) zero points for neutral statements received.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an application for low income housing tax credits that is  
| submitted to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs  
| during an application cycle that is based on the 2020 qualified  
| allocation plan or a subsequent plan adopted by the governing board  
| of the department. An application that is submitted during an  
| application cycle that is based on an earlier qualified allocation  
| plan is governed by the law in effect on the date the application  
| cycle began, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| _REDUCTIONS. (a)_ ___In this section, "across-the-board provider_  
| _reimbursement rate reduction" means a provider reimbursement rate_  
| _reduction proposed by a managed care organization that the_  
| _commission determines is likely to affect more than 50 percent of a_  
| _particular type of provider participating in the organization's_  
| _provider network during the 12-month period following_  
| _implementation of the proposed reduction, regardless of whether:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the organization limits the proposed reduction to_

| _differing percentages of rate reductions or amounts of lost revenue_  
| _as a result of the proposed reduction._  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (e), a managed care_  
| _organization that contracts with the commission to provide health_  
| _care services to recipients may not implement a significant, as_  
| _determined by the commission, across-the-board provider_  
| _reimbursement rate reduction unless the organization:_  
|  _(1)_ _____at least 90 days before the proposed rate_  
| _reduction is to take effect:_  
|  _(A)_ _____provides the commission and affected_  
| _providers with written notice of the proposed rate reduction; and_

| _day after the date the commission receives notice of the proposed_  
| _rate reduction from the managed care organization under Subsection_  
| _(b)(1)(A)._  
|  _(d)_ _____If a managed care organization proposes an_  
| _across-the-board provider reimbursement rate reduction in_  
| _accordance with this section and subsequently rejects alternative_  
| _rate reductions suggested by an affected provider, the organization_  
| _must provide the provider with written notice of that rejection,_  
| _including an explanation of the grounds for the rejection, before_  
| _implementing any rate reduction._  
|  _(e)_ _____This section does not apply to rate reductions that are_  
| _implemented because of reductions to the Medicaid fee schedule or_  
| _cost containment initiatives that are specifically directed by the_  
| _legislature and implemented by the commission._

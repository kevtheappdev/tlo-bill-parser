|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the regulation of certain classes of retail public  
| water utilities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 13.002, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subdivisions (4-b) and (4-c) and adding Subdivision (4-d)  
| to read as follows:  
|  (4-b) "Class B utility" means a public utility that  
| provides retail water or sewer utility service through _2,300_ [ ~~500~~ ]  
| or more taps or connections but fewer than 10,000 taps or  
| connections.  
|  (4-c) "Class C utility" means a public utility that  
| provides retail water or sewer utility service through _500 or more_  
| _taps or connections but_ fewer than _2,300_ [ ~~500~~ ] taps or
connections.  
|  _(4-d)_ _____"Class D utility" means a public utility that_  
| _provides retail water or sewer utility service through fewer than_  
| _500 taps or connections._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 13.046, Water Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (d) to read as follows:  
|  _(d)_ _____At the time the utility commission approves the_  
| _acquisition of a nonfunctioning retail water or sewer utility_  
| _service provider under Section 13.301, the utility commission_  
| _shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____determine the duration of the temporary rates for_  
| _the retail public utility, which must be for a reasonable period;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____rule on the reasonableness of the temporary rates_  
| _under Subsection (b) if the utility commission did not make a ruling_  
| _before the application was filed under Section 13.301._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 13.183(c), Water Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) To ensure that retail customers receive a higher  
| quality, more affordable, or more reliable water or sewer service,  
| to encourage regionalization, or to maintain financially stable and  
| technically sound utilities, the regulatory authority, by rule or  
| ordinance, as appropriate, may adopt specific alternative  
| ratemaking methodologies for water or sewer rates [ ~~based on factors~~  
|  ~~other than rate of return and those specified in Section 13.185~~ ].  
| Overall revenues determined according to an alternative ratemaking  
| methodology adopted under this section must provide revenues to the  
| utility that satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a).  The  
| regulatory authority may not approve rates under an alternative  
| ratemaking methodology unless the regulatory authority adopts the  
| methodology before the date the rate application was  
| administratively complete.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 13.187(a-1), Water Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a-1) A utility may not make changes in its rates except by  
| sending by mail or e-mail a statement of intent to each ratepayer  
| and to the regulatory authority having original jurisdiction at  
| least 35 days before the effective date of the proposed change.  The  
| utility may send the statement of intent to a ratepayer by e-mail  
| only if the ratepayer has agreed to receive communications  
| electronically.  The effective date of the new rates must be the  
| first day of a billing period, and the new rates may not apply to  
| service received before the effective date of the new rates.  The  
| statement of intent must include:  
|  (1) the information required by the regulatory  
| authority's rules;  
|  (2) a billing comparison regarding the existing water  
| rate and the new water rate computed for the use of:  
|  (A) _5,000_ [ ~~10,000~~ ] gallons of water; and  
|  (B) _10,000_ [ ~~30,000~~ ] gallons of water;  
|  (3) a billing comparison regarding the existing sewer  
| rate and the new sewer rate computed for the use of _5,000_ [ ~~10,000~~ ]  
| gallons, unless the utility proposes a flat rate for sewer  
| services; and  
|  (4) a description of the process by which a ratepayer  
| may intervene in the ratemaking proceeding.  
|  SECTION 5. Sections 13.1871(a), (b), and (d), Water Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Except as provided by _Sections 13.18715 and_ [ ~~Section~~ ]  
| 13.1872, this section applies only to a Class B utility.  
|  (b) A utility may not make changes in its rates except by  
| sending by mail or e-mail a statement of intent to each ratepayer  
| and to the regulatory authority having original jurisdiction at  
| least 35 days before the effective date of the proposed change.  The  
| utility may send the statement of intent to a ratepayer by e-mail  
| only if the ratepayer has agreed to receive communications  
| electronically.  The effective date of the new rates must be the  
| first day of a billing period, and the new rates may not apply to  
| service received before the effective date of the new rates.  The  
| statement of intent must include:  
|  (1) the information required by the regulatory  
| authority's rules;  
|  (2) a billing comparison regarding the existing water  
| rate and the new water rate computed for the use of:  
|  (A) _5,000_ [ ~~10,000~~ ] gallons of water; and  
|  (B) _10,000_ [ ~~30,000~~ ] gallons of water;  
|  (3) a billing comparison regarding the existing sewer  
| rate and the new sewer rate computed for the use of _5,000_ [ ~~10,000~~ ]  
| gallons, unless the utility proposes a flat rate for sewer  
| services; and  
|  (4) a description of the process by which a ratepayer  
| may file a complaint under Subsection (i).  
|  (d) When the statement of intent is delivered, the utility  
| shall file with the regulatory authority an application to change  
| rates.  The application must include information the regulatory  
| authority requires by rule and any appropriate cost and rate  
| schedules supporting the requested rate increase.  [ ~~In adopting~~  
|  ~~rules relating to the information required in the application, the~~  
|  ~~utility commission shall ensure that a utility can file a less~~  
|  ~~burdensome and complex application than is required of a Class A~~  
|  ~~utility.~~ ]  If the utility fails to provide within a reasonable time  
| after the application is filed the necessary documentation or other  
| evidence that supports the costs and expenses that are shown in the  
| application, the regulatory authority may disallow the  
| nonsupported costs or expenses.

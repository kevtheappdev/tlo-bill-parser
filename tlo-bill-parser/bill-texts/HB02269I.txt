|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the operations of the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste  
| Disposal Compact waste disposal facility.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter F, Chapter 401, Health and Safety  
| Code, is amended by adding Sections 401.2065 and 401.2066 to read as  
| follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___401.2065._ _____RESERVED CAPACITY FOR PARTY STATE WASTE._  
| _(a) The following are reserved for the exclusive use of party state_  
| _compact waste disposal in the compact waste disposal facility:_  
|  _(1) the greater of:_  
|  _(A) three million total cubic feet; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the required volume identified by the_  
| _commission under Section 401.208; and_  
|  _(2) the greater of:_  
|  _(A) two million total curies; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the required curie capacity identified by the_  
| _commission under Section 401.208._  
|  _(b)_ _____Of the reserved volume and curie capacity described by_  
| _Subsection (a):_  
|  _(1)_ _____80 percent is reserved for compact waste generated_  
| _in the host state; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____20 percent is reserved for compact waste generated_  
| _in nonhost party states._  
|  _Sec._ ___401.2066._ _____CORRECTION FOR DECAY IN DETERMINING_  
| _CAPACITY. The commission shall correct for radioactive decay in_  
| _determining licensed disposal curie capacity in a compact waste_  
| _disposal facility under this subchapter._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 401.207(d) and (g), Health and Safety  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) The compact waste disposal facility license holder may  
| not accept for disposal at the compact waste disposal facility  
| nonparty compact waste that does not meet the waste characteristics  
| and waste forms for disposal applicable to compact waste as set  
| forth by the commission in the compact waste disposal facility  
| license. Before the license holder may accept nonparty compact  
| waste for disposal, the commission must certify [ ~~through a written~~  
|  ~~evaluation~~ ] that the waste is authorized for disposal under the  
| license. If the disposal is not authorized under the license, the  
| commission must inform the license holder of the license amendments  
| necessary to authorize the disposal.  
|  (g) The commission shall assess a surcharge for the disposal  
| of nonparty compact waste at the compact waste disposal facility.  
| The surcharge is _five_ [ ~~20~~ ] percent of the total contracted rate  
| under Section 401.2456 and must be assessed in addition to the total  
| contracted rate under that section.  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter F, Chapter 401, Health and Safety  
| Code, is amended by adding Section 401.2075 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___401.2075._ _____LIMITATION ON NONPARTY COMPACT WASTE. (a)_  
| _The compact waste disposal facility license holder may accept_  
| _nonparty compact waste at the facility only if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the waste is authorized by the compact commission;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the facility has not less than three years' worth_  
| _of constructed capacity based on the average amount of party state_  
| _compact waste disposed in the preceding five years, not including:_  
|  _(A)_ _____low-level radioactive waste from_  
| _decommissioned nuclear electric generation facilities;_  
|  _(B)_ _____oversized low-level radioactive waste_  
| _components; or_  
|  _(C)_ _____low-level radioactive waste from_  
| _nonrecurring events._  
|  _(b)_ _____If a compact waste disposal facility does not have_  
| _sufficient constructed capacity as described by Subsection (a), in_  
| _order to be permitted to accept nonparty compact waste, the compact_  
| _waste disposal facility license holder must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____add constructed capacity sufficient to meet the_  
| _requirements of Subsection (a);_  
|  _(2)_ _____file and have approved by the commission a_  
| _performance bond acceptable to the commission conditioned on the_  
| _construction of additional constructed capacity sufficient to meet_  
| _the requirements of Subsection (a); or_  
|  _(3)_ _____take an alternative action approved by a majority_  
| _of the nuclear electric generation utilities operating in the party_  
| _states._  
|  _(c)_ _____If a party state has notified the federal commission_  
| _that a nuclear electric generation facility located in the state_  
| _will be decommissioned, and the time-phased decommissioning_  
| _schedule and the Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report_  
| _indicate that low-level radioactive waste is to be disposed of at_  
| _the compact waste disposal facility, the compact waste disposal_  
| _facility license holder must have constructed adequate disposal_  
| _capacity at the time of the disposal of waste from the_  
| _decommissioning._  
|  _(d)_ _____The compact waste disposal facility license holder must_  
| _obtain an amendment to the facility operating license to increase_  
| _the allowable curie capacity by two million curies when the compact_  
| _waste disposal facility has reached 80 percent of the total curies_  
| _for which the facility is licensed._  
|  SECTION 4. Subchapter F, Chapter 401, Health and Safety  
| Code, is amended by adding Section 401.2465 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___401.2465._ _____WASTE DISPOSAL FEE COMPARISON. (a) The_  
| _compact waste disposal facility license holder shall conduct an_  
| _annual comparison of party state and nonparty state compact waste_  
| _disposal fees. The comparison:_  
|  _(1) must include:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the total invoiced compact waste disposal_  
| _fees;_  
|  _(B)_ _____the total volume of compact waste disposed;_  
| _and_  
|  _(C)_ _____an average disposal fee calculated by_  
| _dividing the total invoiced compact waste disposal fees by the_  
| _total volume of compact waste disposed; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____may not include information regarding disposal_  
| _fees or disposal volume for:_  
|  _(A)_ _____low-level radioactive waste from_  
| _decommissioned nuclear electric generation facilities;_  
|  _(B)_ _____oversized low-level radioactive waste_  
| _components; or_  
|  _(C)_ _____low-level radioactive waste from_  
| _nonrecurring events._  
|  _(b)_ _____If the average compact waste disposal fee charged to_  
| _party state generators exceeds the average compact waste disposal_  
| _fee charged to nonparty state generators, the compact waste_  
| _disposal facility license holder must issue a rebate for the_  
| _preceding year's fees to the party state generators in an amount_  
| _sufficient to reduce the average compact waste disposal fee charged_  
| _to party state generators after the rebate to $1 less than the_  
| _average compact waste disposal fee charged to nonparty state_  
| _generators._  
|  _(c)_ _____The compact waste disposal facility license holder_  
| _shall allocate the rebate issued under Subsection (b) according to_  
| _the fractional amount of the total compact waste disposal fees paid_  
| _by each generator based on the compact waste disposal facility_  
| _license holder's records for the preceding year._  
|  _(d)_ _____On written request of a nuclear electric generation_  
| _utility operating in a party state, the compact waste disposal_  
| _facility license holder shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____retain an independent auditor, who must be_  
| _approved by the compact waste disposal facility license holder and_  
| _the utility making the request, to evaluate the computation of the_  
| _average compact waste disposal fee and rebate described by this_  
| _section; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____not later than the 90th day after the date the_  
| _license holder receives the final audit report, make a copy of the_  
| _report available to the requesting utility._  
|  SECTION 5. Sections 401.271(a) and (b), Health and Safety  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) A holder of a license issued by the commission under  
| this chapter that authorizes the disposal of a radioactive  
| substance from other persons shall remit each quarter an amount  
| equal to _five_ [ ~~10~~ ] percent of the license holder's gross receipts  
| received from disposal operations under _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] license [ ~~issued~~  
|  ~~under this chapter that occur after the effective date of the Act~~  
|  ~~enacting this section as follows:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~five percent shall be remitted to the comptroller~~  
|  ~~for deposit to the credit of the general revenue fund; and~~  
|  [ ~~(2) five percent shall be remitted~~] to the host  
| county in accordance with Sections 401.244(b) and (d).  
|  (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to [ ~~compact waste or~~  
|  ~~federal facility waste as defined by Section 401.2005 or~~ ]  
| industrial solid waste as defined by Section 361.003.

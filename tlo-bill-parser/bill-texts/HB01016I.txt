|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to eligibility determinations for the STAR+PLUS home and  
| community based services (HCBS) program.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter A, Chapter 533, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 533.00282 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___533.00282._ _____ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS FOR STAR+PLUS_  
| _HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES (HCBS) PROGRAM._ ___(a)_ ___The_  
| _commission shall determine Medicaid eligibility for an applicant_  
| _for the STAR+PLUS home and community based services (HCBS) program_  
| _not later than:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the 20th day after the date the applicant submits_  
| _the application; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the 45th day after the date the applicant submits_  
| _the application, if the applicant is applying on the basis of a_  
| _disability._  
|  _(b)_ _____A managed care organization with which the commission_  
| _contracts to provide health care services to recipients shall, not_  
| _later than the 30th day after the date an applicant for the_  
| _STAR+PLUS home and community based services (HCBS) program submits_  
| _the application, complete and submit to the entity serving as this_  
| _state's Medicaid claims administrator the applicant's:_  
|  _(1) individual service plan; and_  
|  _(2) medical necessity and level of care assessment._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 533.00282(a), Government Code, as added  
| by this Act, applies only to an application for a determination of  
| Medicaid eligibility submitted on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. An application for a determination of Medicaid  
| eligibility submitted before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect immediately before the effective date  
| of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3\.  (a) The Health and Human Services Commission  
| shall, in a contract between the commission and a managed care  
| organization under Chapter 533, Government Code, that is entered  
| into or renewed on or after the effective date of this Act, require  
| that the managed care organization comply with Section  
| 533.00282(b), Government Code, as added by this Act.  
|  (b) The Health and Human Services Commission shall seek to  
| amend contracts entered into with managed care organizations under  
| Chapter 533, Government Code, before the effective date of this Act  
| to require those managed care organizations to comply with Section  
| 533.00282(b), Government Code, as added by this Act. To the extent  
| of a conflict between Section 533.00282(b), Government Code, as  
| added by this Act, and a provision of a contract with a managed care  
| organization entered into before the effective date of this Act,  
| the contract provision prevails.  
|  SECTION 4. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

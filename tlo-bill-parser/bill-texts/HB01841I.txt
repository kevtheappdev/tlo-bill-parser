| Code, and that is located on land owned by the trust and leased by

|  _(2) has a term of at least 40 years;_  
|  _(3)_ _____restricts the price for which the housing unit may_  
| _be sold to a price that is or may be less than the market value of_  
| _the housing unit; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____restricts the sale of the housing unit to a family_  
| _meeting the income-eligibility standards established by Section_  
| _373B.006, Local Government Code._

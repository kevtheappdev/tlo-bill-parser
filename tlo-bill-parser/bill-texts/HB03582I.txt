| _49.06, Penal Code, shall require that the defendant as a condition_  
| _of community supervision have an ignition interlock device_  
| _installed on the motor vehicle owned by the defendant or on the_  
| _vehicle most regularly driven by the defendant and that the_  
| _defendant not operate any motor vehicle that is not equipped with_  
| _that device, unless the judge finds that restricting the defendant_  
| _to the operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition_  
| _interlock device would not be in the best interest of society and_  
| _enters that finding in the record. This subsection applies_  
| _regardless of whether the defendant would be required to have an_  
| _ignition interlock device installed on conviction of the offense_  
| _for which deferred adjudication community supervision is granted._ __  
| _If the judge determines the defendant is unable to pay for the_  
| _ignition interlock device, the judge may impose a reasonable_

| _finding that the defendant is indigent and reduce the costs to the_  
| _defendant by ordering a waiver of the installation charge for the_  
| _ignition interlock device and a 50 percent reduction of the monthly_  
| _device monitoring fee. A reduction in costs ordered under this_  
| _subsection does not apply to any fees that may be assessed against_  
| _the defendant if the ignition interlock device detects ethyl_  
| _alcohol on the breath of the person attempting to operate the motor_  
| _vehicle._

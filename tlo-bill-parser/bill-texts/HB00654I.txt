|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the definition of "affected person" for purposes of a  
| contested case hearing held by or for the Texas Commission on  
| Environmental Quality regarding certain environmental permit  
| applications.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 5.115(a), Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) For the purpose of an administrative hearing held by or  
| for the commission involving a contested case, "affected person,"  
| or "person affected," or "person who may be affected" means a person  
| who has a personal justiciable interest related to a legal right,  
| duty, privilege, power, or economic interest affected by the  
| administrative hearing.  An interest common to members of the  
| general public does not qualify as a personal justiciable interest.  
| _For the purpose of an administrative hearing held by or for the_  
| _commission involving a contested case regarding a permit_  
| _application referred under Section 5.556 or 5.557, the state_  
| _senator and representative who represent the area in which the_  
| _facility to which the application relates is located or proposed to_  
| _be located are considered affected persons._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an application for a permit that is filed with the Texas Commission  
| on Environmental Quality on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An application for a permit filed before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law in effect on the date of filing, and that  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

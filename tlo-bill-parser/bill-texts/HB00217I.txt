| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) Covered benefits under this _subchapter_ [ ~~chapter~~ ] are  
| limited to the most appropriate model of prosthetic device or  
| orthotic device that adequately meets the medical needs of the  
| enrollee as determined by the enrollee's treating physician or  
| podiatrist and prosthetist or orthotist, as applicable.  
|  (c) Subject to applicable copayments and deductibles, the  
| repair and replacement of a prosthetic device or orthotic device is  
| a covered benefit under this _subchapter_ [ ~~chapter~~ ] unless the repair  
| or replacement is necessitated by misuse or loss by the enrollee.  
|  (e) Covered benefits under this _subchapter_ [ ~~chapter~~ ] may be  
| provided by a pharmacy that has employees who are qualified under  
| the Medicare system and applicable Medicaid regulations to service  
| and bill for orthotic services.  This _subchapter_ [ ~~chapter~~ ] does not  
| preclude a pharmacy from being reimbursed by a health benefit plan

| provided through out-of-network services must be comparable to that  
| provided through in-network services.

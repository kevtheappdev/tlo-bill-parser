| _association are unable to agree on an appraisal umpire to_  
| _participate in the resolution of the dispute, the commissioner_

|  _(2)_ _____charge a reasonable registration fee to defray the_  
| _cost incurred by the department in maintaining the roster and the_  
| _commissioner in selecting an appraisal umpire under this_

| _demand appraisal before the expiration of the periods described by_  
| _Subsections (b) and (c) waives the claimant's right to contest the_  
| _association's determination of the amount of loss the association_  
| _will pay with reference to a fully accepted claim or the accepted_  
| _portion of a partially accepted claim._  
|  _(g)_ _____A claimant or the association may, not later than the_  
| _second anniversary of the date of an appraisal decision, file an_  
| _action in a district court in the county in which the loss that is_  
| _the subject of the appraisal occurred to vacate the appraisal_  
| _decision and begin a new appraisal process if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the appraisal decision was obtained by corruption,_  
| _fraud, or other undue means;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the rights of the claimant or the association were_  
| _prejudiced by:_  
|  _(A) evident partiality by an appraisal umpire;_  
|  _(B)_ _____corruption in an appraiser or appraisal_

|  _(C)_ _____misconduct or wilful misbehavior of an_  
| _appraiser or appraisal umpire; or_  
|  _(3) an appraiser or appraisal umpire:_  
|  _(A)_ _____exceeded the appraiser's or appraisal_  
| _umpire's powers;_  
|  _(B)_ _____refused to postpone the appraisal after a_  
| _showing of sufficient cause for the postponement;_  
|  _(C)_ _____refused to consider evidence material to the_  
| _claim; or_  
|  _(D)_ _____conducted the appraisal in a manner that_  
| _substantially prejudiced the rights of the claimant or the_  
| _association._  
|  _(h)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (g), a claimant may not_  
| _bring an action against the association with reference to a claim_  
| _for which the association has accepted coverage in full._  
|  _Sec._ ___2211.175._ _____DISPUTES CONCERNING DENIED COVERAGE. (a)_  
| _If the association denies coverage for a claim in part or in full_  
| _and the claimant disputes that determination, the claimant, not_  
| _later than the expiration of the limitations period described by_  
| _Section 2211.177(a) but_ ___after the date the claimant receives the_  
| _notice described by Section 2211.173(d)(2) or (3), must provide the_  
| _association with notice that the claimant intends to bring an_  
| _action against the association concerning the partial or full_  
| _denial of the claim. A claimant that does not provide notice of_  
| _intent to bring an action before the expiration of the period_  
| _described by this subsection waives the claimant's right to contest_  
| _the association's partial or full denial of coverage and is barred_  
| _from bringing an action against the association concerning the_  
| _denial of coverage._  
|  _(b)_ _____If a claimant provides notice of intent to bring an_  
| _action under Subsection (a), the association may require the_  
| _claimant, as a prerequisite to filing the action against the_  
| _association, to submit the dispute to alternative dispute_  
| _resolution by mediation or moderated settlement conference, as_  
| _provided by Chapter 154, Civil Practice and Remedies Code._  
|  _(c)_ _____The association must request alternative dispute_

| _the 60th day after the date the association receives from the_  
| _claimant notice of intent to bring an action._  
|  _(d)_ _____Alternative dispute resolution under this section must_  
| _be completed not later than the 60th day after the date a request_  
| _for alternative dispute resolution is made under Subsection (c)._  
| _The 60-day period described by this subsection may be extended by_  
| _the commissioner in accordance with Section 2211.180 or by the_  
| _association and a claimant by mutual consent._  
|  _(e)_ _____If the claimant is not satisfied after completion of_  
| _alternative dispute resolution, or if alternative dispute_  
| _resolution is not completed before the expiration of the 60-day_  
| _period described by Subsection (d) or any extension under that_  
| _subsection, the claimant may bring an action against the_  
| _association in a district court in the county in which the loss that_  
| _is the subject of the coverage denial occurred. An action brought_  
| _under this subsection shall be presided over by a judge appointed by_  
| _the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation designated under_  
| _Section 74.161, Government Code. A judge appointed under this_  
| _subsection must be an active judge, as defined by Section 74.041,_  
| _Government Code, who is a resident of the county in which the loss_  
| _that is the basis of the disputed denied coverage occurred or of a_  
| _county adjacent to the county in which that loss occurred._  
|  _(f)_ _____If a claimant brings an action against the association_  
| _concerning a partial or full denial of coverage, the court shall_  
| _abate the action until the notice of intent to bring an action has_  
| _been provided and, if requested by the association, the dispute has_  
| _been submitted to alternative dispute resolution, in accordance_  
| _with this section._  
|  _(g)_ _____A moderated settlement conference under this section_  
| _may be conducted by a panel consisting of one or more impartial_  
| _third parties._

| _section, the claimant and the association are responsible in equal_  
| _shares for paying any costs incurred or charged in connection with_  
| _the mediation._  
|  _(i)_ _____If the association requests mediation under this_  
| _section, and the claimant and the association are able to agree on a_  
| _mediator, the mediator is the mediator agreed to by the claimant and_  
| _the association. If the claimant and the association are unable to_  
| _agree on a mediator, the commissioner shall select a mediator from a_  
| _roster of qualified mediators maintained by the department. The_  
| _department may:_  
|  _(1)_ _____require mediators to register with the department_  
| _as a condition of being placed on the roster; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____charge a reasonable registration fee to defray the_  
| _cost incurred by the department in maintaining the roster and the_  
| _commissioner in selecting a mediator under this subsection._  
|  _(j)_ _____The commissioner shall establish rules to implement_  
| _this section, including provisions for expediting alternative_  
| _dispute resolution, facilitating the ability of a claimant to_  
| _appear with or without counsel, establishing qualifications_  
| _necessary for mediators to be placed on the roster maintained by the_  
| _department under Subsection (i), and providing that formal rules of_  
| _evidence shall not apply to the proceedings._  
|  _Sec._ ___2211.176._ _____ISSUES BROUGHT TO SUIT; LIMITATIONS ON_  
| _RECOVERY. (a) The only issues a claimant may raise in an action_  
| _brought against the association under Section 2211.175 are:_

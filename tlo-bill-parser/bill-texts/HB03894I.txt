| _employee._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Investigator" means an agent or employee of the_  
| _county who is assigned to conduct an investigation._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Normally assigned working hours" includes those_

| _determined by the sheriff or the sheriff's designee, requires_  
| _interrogation at another time; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the employee is compensated for the interrogation_  
| _time on an overtime basis._  
|  _(c)_ _____The sheriff may not consider work time missed from_

| _or in determining the severity of a punitive action._  
|  _(d)_ _____An investigator may not interrogate an employee who is_  
| _the subject of an investigation or conduct any part of the_  
| _investigation at that employee's home without that employee's_

| _if the person is the complainant, the ultimate decision maker_  
| _regarding disciplinary action, or a person who has any personal_  
| _involvement regarding the alleged misconduct. An employee who is_  
| _the subject of an investigation has the right to inquire and, on_  
| _inquiry, to be informed of the identities of each investigator_

| _investigation or interrogation. If the limitation would hinder the_  
| _investigation or interrogation, the employee under investigation_  
| _must be furnished, as soon as practicable, a written statement of_  
| _the nature of the investigation, the name of each complaining_  
| _party, and the complaint, affidavit, or statement._  
|  _(g)_ _____An interrogation session of an employee who is the_  
| _subject of an investigation may not be unreasonably long. In_  
| _determining reasonableness, the gravity and complexity of the_  
| _investigation must be considered. The investigators shall allow_  
| _reasonable interruptions to permit the employee to attend to_  
| _personal physical necessities._  
|  _(h)_ _____An investigator may not threaten an employee who is the_  
| _subject of an investigation with punitive action during an_  
| _interrogation. However, an investigator may inform an employee_  
| _that failure to truthfully answer reasonable questions directly_  
| _related to the investigation or to fully cooperate in the conduct of_  
| _the investigation may result in punitive action._  
|  _(i)_ _____If prior notification of intent to record an_  
| _interrogation is given to the other party, either the investigator_  
| _or the employee who is the subject of an interrogation may record_  
| _the interrogation._

| _against an employee but does result in a reprimand recorded in_  
| _writing or an adverse finding or determination regarding that_  
| _employee, the reprimand, finding, or determination may not be_  
| _placed in that employee's personnel file unless the employee is_  
| _first given an opportunity to read and sign the document. If the_  
| _employee refuses to sign the reprimand, finding, or determination,_  
| _it may be placed in the personnel file with a notation that the_  
| _employee refused to sign it. An employee may respond in writing to_  
| _a reprimand, finding, or determination that is placed in the_  
| _employee's personnel file under this subsection by submitting a_  
| _written response to the commission within 10 days after the date the_  
| _employee is asked to sign the document. The response must be placed_  
| _in the personnel file. An employee who receives a punitive action_  
| _and who elects not to appeal the action may file a written response_  
| _as prescribed by this subsection within 10 days after the date the_  
| _employee is given written notice of the punitive action from the_  
| _sheriff._  
|  _(k)_ _____If the sheriff or any investigator violates any of the_  
| _provisions of this section while conducting an investigation, the_

|  AN ACT  
| relating to the standard of proof in health care liability claims  
| involving emergency medical care.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 74.153, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 74.153. STANDARD OF PROOF IN CASES INVOLVING EMERGENCY  
| MEDICAL CARE. _(a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), in_ [ ~~In~~ ] a  
| suit involving a health care liability claim against a physician or  
| health care provider for injury to or death of a patient arising out  
| of the provision of emergency medical care in a hospital emergency  
| department _, in an_ [ ~~or~~ ] obstetrical unit _for the initial
evaluation_  
| _or treatment of a patient with an obstetric emergency,_ or in a  
| surgical suite immediately following the evaluation or treatment of  
| a patient in a hospital emergency department, the claimant bringing  
| the suit may prove that the treatment or lack of treatment by the  
| physician or health care provider departed from accepted standards  
| of medical care or health care only if the claimant shows by a  
| preponderance of the evidence that the physician or health care  
| provider, with wilful and wanton negligence, deviated from the  
| degree of care and skill that is reasonably expected of an  
| ordinarily prudent physician or health care provider in the same or  
| similar circumstances.  
|  _(b)_ _____Subsection (a) does not apply to medical care or_  
| _treatment:_  
|  _(1)_ _____provided when a patient arrives at a health care_  
| _institution:_  
|  _(A) in stable condition; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____capable of receiving medical care or_  
| _treatment as a nonemergency patient;_  
|  _(2) provided after the patient is:_  
|  _(A) stabilized; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____capable of receiving medical care or_  
| _treatment as a nonemergency patient;_  
|  _(3)_ _____provided in an obstetrical unit if the patient_  
| _arrives at a hospital for medical care or treatment for a_  
| _non-obstetric emergency;_  
|  _(4)_ _____that is unrelated to the original medical_  
| _emergency for which the patient initially sought medical care or_  
| _treatment; or_  
|  _(5)_ _____that is related to an emergency caused wholly or_  
| _partly by the negligence of any defendant._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 74.153, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, as amended by this Act, applies only to a cause of action that  
| accrues on or after the effective date of this Act. A cause of  
| action that accrues before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law applicable to the cause of action immediately  
| before the effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

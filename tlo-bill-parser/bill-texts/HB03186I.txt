|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 74.351, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, is amended by amending Subsections (a) and (c) and adding  
| Subsections (a-1) and (a-2) to read as follows:  
|  (a) In a health care liability claim, a claimant shall _:_  
|  _(1)_ [ ~~,~~ ] not later than the 120th day after the date  
| each defendant's original answer is filed, serve on that party or  
| the party's attorney one or more expert reports, with a curriculum  
| vitae of each expert listed in the report for each physician or  
| health care provider against whom a liability claim is asserted _;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____not later than the 60th day after the date the_  
| _claimant files an amended or supplemental pleading that asserts a_  
| _theory of direct liability against a defendant against whom the_  
| _claimant had previously asserted only a theory of vicarious_  
| _liability, serve on that defendant or that defendant's attorney:_  
|  _(A)_ _____an expert report that addresses at least one_  
| _theory of direct liability asserted against that defendant in the_  
| _amended or supplemental pleading; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____a curriculum vitae of each expert listed in_  
| _that expert report_.  
|  _(a-1)_ The date for serving _an expert_ [ ~~the~~ ] report _under_  
| _Subsection (a)_ may be extended by written agreement of the affected  
| parties.  
|  _(a-2)_ Each defendant physician or health care provider  
| whose conduct is implicated in a report must file and serve any  
| objection to the sufficiency of the report not later than the later  
| of the 21st day after the date the report is served or the 21st day  
| after the date the defendant's answer is filed, failing which all  
| objections are waived.  
|  (c) If an expert report has not been served within the  
| period specified by Subsection (a) because elements of the report  
| are found deficient, the court may grant one 30-day extension to the  
| claimant in order to cure the deficiency. If the claimant does not  
| receive notice of the court's ruling granting the extension until  
| after the _applicable_ [ ~~120-day~~ ] deadline _under Subsection (a)_ has  
| passed, then the 30-day extension shall run from the date the  
| plaintiff first received the notice.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only

| governed by the law as it existed immediately before the effective  
| date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

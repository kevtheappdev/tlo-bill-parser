|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to procedures for imposing certain administrative  
| penalties or disgorgement orders by the Public Utility Commission  
| of Texas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 15.024, Utilities Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b), (e), and (f) and adding Subsection (b-1)  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) Not later than the 14th day after the date the report is  
| issued, the executive director shall give written notice of the  
| report to the person against whom the penalty may be assessed. The  
| notice may be given by _regular or_ certified mail. The notice must:  
|  (1) include a brief summary of the alleged violation;  
|  (2) state the amount of the recommended penalty; and  
|  (3) inform the person that the person has a right to a  
| hearing on the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the  
| penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of  
| the penalty.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____If the commission sends written notice to a person by_  
| _mail addressed to the person's mailing address as maintained in the_  
| _commission's records, the person is deemed to have received notice:_  
|  _(1)_ _____on the fifth day after the date that the commission_  
| _sent the written notice, for notice sent by regular mail; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____on the date the written notice is received or_  
| _delivery is refused, for notice sent by certified mail._  
|  (e) If the person accepts the executive director's  
| determination and recommended penalty _or fails to timely respond to_  
| _the notice_ , the commission by order shall approve the determination  
| and impose the recommended penalty _or order a hearing on the_  
| _determination and the recommended penalty_.  
|  (f) If the person requests a hearing or _the commission_  
| _orders a hearing under Subsection (e)_ [ ~~fails to timely respond to~~  
|  ~~the notice~~ ], the _commission_ [ ~~executive director~~ ] shall _refer
the_  
| _matter to the State Office of Administrative Hearings for_ [ ~~set~~ ] a  
| hearing and give notice of the _referral_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] to the person.  
| The parties to a proceeding under this subchapter shall be limited  
| to the person and the commission, including the independent market  
| monitor.  The hearing shall be held by an administrative law judge  
| of the State Office of Administrative Hearings _and notice of the_  
| _hearing must be provided in accordance with Chapter 2001,_  
| _Government Code_.  The administrative law judge shall make findings  
| of fact and conclusions of law and promptly issue to the commission  
| a proposal for a decision about the occurrence of the violation and  
| the amount of a proposed penalty.  Based on the findings of fact,  
| conclusions of law, and proposal for a decision, the commission by  
| order may find that a violation has occurred and impose a penalty or  
| disgorgement order or may find that no violation occurred.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| the procedures for an administrative penalty or disgorgement order  
| for which a written notice is given under Section 15.024(b),  
| Utilities Code, on or after the effective date of this Act.  Those  
| procedures for a penalty or order for which a written notice is  
| given before the effective date of this Act are governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the notice is given, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

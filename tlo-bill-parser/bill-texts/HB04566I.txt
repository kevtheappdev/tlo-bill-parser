| Criminal Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A defendant confined in a state jail felony facility

| _shall_ [ ~~may~~ ] be awarded diligent participation credit in accordance  
| with Subsection (f) [ ~~or (g)~~ ].

|  ~~felony facility, the~~ ] department shall credit against any time the  
| defendant is required to serve in a state jail felony facility  
| additional time for each day the defendant actually served in the  
| facility while diligently participating in an educational,  
| vocational, treatment, or work program.  
|  (h) A time credit under Subsection (f) [ ~~or (g)~~ ] may not  
| exceed one-fifth of the amount of time the defendant is originally  
| required to serve in the facility.  A defendant may not be awarded a  
| time credit under Subsection (f) [ ~~or (g)~~ ] for any period during  
| which the defendant is subject to disciplinary status.  A time  
| credit under Subsection (f) [ ~~or (g)~~ ] is a privilege and not a right.  
|  SECTION 2. The following provisions of the Code of Criminal  
| Procedure are repealed:  
|  (1) Article 42.0199; and  
|  (2) Article 42A.559(g).  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a person confined in a state jail felony facility for an offense  
| committed on or after the effective date of this Act. A person  
| confined in a state jail felony facility for an offense committed  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect when the offense was committed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose. For purposes of this section,  
| an offense was committed before the effective date of this Act if  
| any element of the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| _SUBCHAPTER D. MANDATORY PAYMENTS_  
|  _Sec._ ___298C.151._ _____MANDATORY PAYMENTS. (a) If the board_  
| _authorizes a program under this chapter, the board, subject to the_  
| _approval of the commissioners court, may require an annual_  
| _mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each_  
| _institutional health care provider located in the district. The_  
| _commissioners court may provide that the mandatory payment is to be_  
| _collected at least annually, but not more often than quarterly. In_  
| _the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the_  
| _mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an_  
| _institutional health care provider as determined by the data_  
| _reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections_  
| _311.032 and 311.033 in the most recent fiscal year for which that_  
| _data was reported. If the institutional health care provider did_  
| _not report any data under those sections, the provider's net_  
| _patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as contained in the_  
| _provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the previous fiscal_  
| _year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for which the_  
| _provider submitted the Medicare cost report._  
|  _(b)_ _____The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this_  
| _chapter must be a uniform percentage of the amount of net patient_  
| _revenue generated by each paying hospital in the district. A_  
| _mandatory payment authorized under this chapter may not hold_  
| _harmless any institutional health care provider, as required under_  
| _42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w)._  
|  _(c)_ _____The aggregate amount of the mandatory payments required_  
| _of all paying hospitals in the district may not exceed six percent_  
| _of the aggregate net patient revenue of all paying hospitals in the_  
| _district._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to the maximum amount prescribed by Subsection_  
| _(c), the board, with the approval of the commissioners court, shall_  
| _set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will_  
| _generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of_  
| _the county for activities under this chapter, fund an_  
| _intergovernmental transfer described by Section 298C.103(b)(1), or_  
| _make other payments authorized under this chapter. The mandatory_  
| _payment amounts must be set based on reasonable estimates of the_  
| _amount of revenue necessary to fully meet and cover authorized_  
| _expenses under this chapter. The amount of revenue from mandatory_  
| _payments that may be used for administrative expenses by the county_  
| _in a year may not exceed $25,000, plus the cost of collateralization_  
| _of deposits. If the county demonstrates to the paying hospitals_  
| _that the costs of administering the program under this chapter,_  
| _excluding those costs associated with the collateralization of_  
| _deposits, exceed $25,000 in any year, on consent of a majority of_  
| _all of the paying hospitals, the county may use additional revenue_  
| _from mandatory payments received under this chapter to compensate_  
| _the county for its administrative expenses. A paying hospital may_  
| _not unreasonably withhold consent to compensate the county for_  
| _administrative expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _____A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient or insurer._  
|  _(f)_ _____A mandatory payment under this chapter is not a tax for_  
| _purposes of Section 4, Article IX, Texas Constitution, or Chapter_  
| _1053, Special District Local Laws Code._  
|  _Sec._ ___298C.152._ _____ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF MANDATORY_  
| _PAYMENTS. The county may collect or contract for the assessment and_  
| _collection of mandatory payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___298C.153._ _____CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE. To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the board may provide by_  
| _rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the_  
| _requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services. A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose,_  
| _or materially expand the legal or financial liability or_  
| _responsibility of the district or an institutional health care_  
| _provider in the district beyond the provisions of this chapter._  
| _This section does not require the board to adopt a rule._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

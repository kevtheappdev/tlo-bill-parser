|  AN ACT  
| relating to the eligibility of certain defendants for release on  
| personal bond.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 17.03, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsection (b-2) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (b-1) _, or_  
| _(b-2)_ , a magistrate may, in the magistrate's discretion, release  
| the defendant on personal bond without sureties or other security.  
|  _(b-2)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a magistrate shall_  
| _release on personal bond a defendant who is charged with a_  
| _misdemeanor unless the magistrate makes an affirmative finding of_  
| _fact and files a statement of that affirmative finding with the_  
| _papers in the case that extenuating circumstances justify not_  
| _releasing the defendant on personal bond._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a personal bond that is executed on or after the effective date  
| of this Act. A personal bond executed before the effective date of

| executed, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.

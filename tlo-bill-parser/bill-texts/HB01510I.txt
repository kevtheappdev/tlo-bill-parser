|  ~~application for renewal coverage, and payment of premiums, from a~~  
|  ~~property and casualty agent or a person insured under this~~  
|  ~~chapter.~~ ]  An application for initial [ ~~or renewal~~ ] coverage must  
| contain:  
|  (1) a statement as to whether the applicant has  
| submitted or will submit the _required_ premium _payment_ [ ~~in full~~ ]  
| from personal funds or, if not, to whom a balance is or will be due;

|  (2) a statement that the agent acting on behalf of the  
| applicant possesses proof of the declination described by  
| Subsection (a) and proof of flood insurance coverage or  
| unavailability of that coverage as described by Section  
| 2210.203(a-1).  
|  SECTION 7. Sections 2210.203(a) and (c), Insurance Code,

| the issuance of an insurance policy as provided by the plan of  
| operation.

|  _(A)_ _____the declination required by Section_  
| _2210.202;_  
|  _(B)_ _____flood insurance coverage required by Section_  
| _2210.203; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____any other information related to_  
| _insurability of a property, including changes to the condition or_  
| _value of the property that would affect the availability of_  
| _coverage or premium cost to insure the property; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____provide an opportunity for the policyholder to_  
| _elect to cancel the policy before the policy automatically renews._  
|  _Sec._ ___2210.2032._ _____PREMIUM PAYMENT METHODS. (a)_ ___The_

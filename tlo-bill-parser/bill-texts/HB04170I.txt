| section designations.  
|  SECTION 1.002. (a) The repeal of a statute by this Act does  
| not affect an amendment, revision, or reenactment of the statute by  
| the 86th Legislature, Regular Session, 2019. The amendment,  
| revision, or reenactment is preserved and given effect as part of  
| the code provision that revised the statute so amended, revised, or  
| reenacted.

| enacted by the 86th Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, the statute  
| controls.

| law codified by this Act applies to the codified law to the same

| Act does not affect the application of the provision to the codified

| validating law, by this Act does not remove, void, or otherwise

| electric cooperative that is offering customer choice. If there is  
| a conflict between the specific provisions of this chapter and any  
| other provisions of this title, except for Chapters 40 and 41, the  
| provisions of this chapter control.  
|  SECTION 16.002. Section 39.352(g), Utilities Code, is  
| amended to correct a reference to read as follows:  
|  (g) If a retail electric provider serves an aggregate load  
| in excess of 300 megawatts within this state, not less than five  
| percent of the load in megawatt hours must consist of residential  
| customers. This requirement applies to an affiliated retail  
| electric provider only with respect to load served outside of the  
| electric utility's service area, and, in relation to that load, the  
| affiliated retail electric provider shall meet the requirements of  
| this subsection by serving residential customers outside of the  
| electric utility's service area. For the purpose of this  
| subsection, the load served by retail electric providers that are  
| under common ownership shall be combined. A retail electric  
| provider may meet the requirements of this subsection by  
| demonstrating on an annual basis that it serves residential load  
| amounting to five percent of its total load _or_ [ ~~,~~ ] by demonstrating  
| that another retail electric provider serves sufficient qualifying  
| residential load on its behalf[ ~~, or by paying an amount into the~~  
|  ~~system benefit fund equal to $1 multiplied by a number equal to the~~  
|  ~~difference between the number of megawatt hours it sold to~~  
|  ~~residential customers and the number of megawatt hours it was~~  
|  ~~required to sell to such customers, or in the case of an affiliated~~  
|  ~~retail electric provider, $1 multiplied by a number equal to the~~  
|  ~~difference between the number of megawatt hours sold to residential~~  
|  ~~customers outside of the electric utility's service area and the~~  
|  ~~number of megawatt hours it was required to sell to such customers~~  
|  ~~outside of the electric utility's service area~~ ]. Qualifying  
| residential load may not include customers served by an affiliated  
| retail electric provider in its own service area. Each retail  
| electric provider shall file reports with the commission that are  
| necessary to implement this subsection. This subsection applies  
| for 36 months after retail competition begins. The commission  
| shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.  
|  SECTION 16.003. Section 39.905(f), Utilities Code, is  
| amended to correct a reference to read as follows:  
|  (f) _Each_ [ ~~Unless funding is provided under Section 39.903,~~  
|  ~~each~~ ] unbundled transmission and distribution utility shall  
| include in its energy efficiency plan a targeted low-income energy  
| efficiency program [ ~~as described by Section 39.903(f)(2)~~ ], and the  
| savings achieved by the program shall count toward the transmission  
| and distribution utility's energy efficiency goal. The commission  
| shall determine the appropriate level of funding to be allocated to  
| both targeted and standard offer low-income energy efficiency  
| programs in each unbundled transmission and distribution utility  
| service area. The level of funding for low-income energy  
| efficiency programs shall be provided from money approved by the  
| commission for the transmission and distribution utility's energy  
| efficiency programs. The commission shall ensure that annual  
| expenditures for the targeted low-income energy efficiency  
| programs of each unbundled transmission and distribution utility  
| are not less than 10 percent of the transmission and distribution  
| utility's energy efficiency budget for the year. A targeted  
| low-income energy efficiency program must comply with the same  
| audit requirements that apply to federal weatherization  
| subrecipients. In an energy efficiency cost recovery factor  
| proceeding related to expenditures under this subsection, the  
| commission shall make findings of fact regarding whether the  
| utility meets requirements imposed under this subsection. The  
| state agency that administers the federal weatherization  
| assistance program shall participate in energy efficiency cost  
| recovery factor proceedings related to expenditures under this  
| subsection to ensure that targeted low-income weatherization  
| programs are consistent with federal weatherization programs and  
| adequately funded.

| natural gas energy credits program under Section 39.9044(b); and  
|  (7) to require reports of municipally owned utility  
| operations only to the extent necessary to:  
|  (A) enable the commission to determine the  
| aggregate load and energy requirements of the state and the  
| resources available to serve that load; or

| provision of law, except Sections 39.155, 39.157(e), 39.203,  
| [ ~~39.903,~~ ] and 39.904, this chapter governs the transition to and  
| the establishment of a fully competitive electric power industry  
| for electric cooperatives. Regarding the regulation of electric  
| cooperatives, this chapter shall control over any other provision

| Session, 2017, is repealed as duplicative of Section 11.122(b-1),  
| Water Code, as added by Chapter 429 (S.B. 1430), Acts of the 85th  
| Legislature, Regular Session, 2017.  
|  SECTION 17.002. Section 54.016(a), Water Code, as amended  
| by Chapters 761 (S.B. 1987) and 965 (S.B. 2014), Acts of the 85th  
| Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, is reenacted to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) No land within the corporate limits of a city or within  
| the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city, shall be included in a  
| district unless the city grants its written consent, by resolution  
| or ordinance, to the inclusion of the land within the district in  
| accordance with Section 42.042, Local Government Code, and this  
| section. The request to a city for its written consent to the  
| creation of a district, shall be signed by a majority in value of  
| the holders of title of the land within the proposed district as  
| indicated by the county tax rolls. A petition for the written  
| consent of a city to the inclusion of land within a district shall  
| describe the boundaries of the land to be included in the district  
| by metes and bounds or by lot and block number, if there is a  
| recorded map or plat and survey of the area, and state the general  
| nature of the work proposed to be done, the necessity for the work,  
| and the cost of the project as then estimated by those filing the  
| petition. If, at the time a petition is filed with a city for  
| creation of a district, the district proposes to connect to a city's  
| water or sewer system or proposes to contract with a regional water  
| and wastewater provider which has been designated as such by the  
| commission as of the date such petition is filed, to which the city  
| has made a capital contribution for the water and wastewater  
| facilities serving the area, the proposed district shall be  
| designated as a "city service district." If such proposed district  
| does not meet the criteria for a city service district at the time  
| the petition seeking creation is filed, such district shall be  
| designated as a "noncity service district." The city's consent  
| shall not place any restrictions or conditions on the creation of a  
| noncity service district as defined by this chapter other than  
| those expressly provided in Subsection (e) of this section and  
| shall specifically not limit the amounts of the district's bonds. A  
| city may not require annexation as a consent to creation of any  
| district. A city shall not refuse to approve a district bond issue  
| for any reason except that the district is not in compliance with  
| valid consent requirements applicable to the district. If a city  
| grants its written consent without the concurrence of the applicant  
| to the creation of a noncity service district containing conditions  
| or restrictions that the petitioning land owner or owners  
| reasonably believe exceed the city's powers, such land owner or  
| owners may petition the commission to create the district and to  
| modify the conditions and restrictions of the city's consent. The  
| commission may declare any provision of the consent to be null and  
| void. The commission may approve the creation of a district that  
| includes any portion of the land covered by the city's consent to  
| creation of the district. The legislature may create and may  
| validate the creation of a district that includes any portion of the  
| land covered by the city's consent to the creation of the district.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the consideration of a subsequent writ of habeas corpus  
| in certain felony cases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 4(a), Article 11.07, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) If a subsequent application for writ of habeas corpus is  
| filed after final disposition of an initial application challenging  
| the same conviction, a court may not consider the merits of or grant  
| relief based on the subsequent application unless _the attorney_  
| _representing the state consents in writing to that consideration or_  
| _unless_ the application contains sufficient specific facts  
| establishing that:  
|  (1) the current claims and issues have not been and  
| could not have been presented previously in an original application  
| or in a previously considered application filed under this article  
| because the factual or legal basis for the claim was unavailable on  
| the date the applicant filed the previous application; or  
|  (2) by a preponderance of the evidence, but for a  
| violation of the United States Constitution no rational juror could  
| have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 4(a), Article 11.07, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, as amended by this Act, applies only to an application  
| for a writ of habeas corpus filed on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. An application filed before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the application was  
| filed, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

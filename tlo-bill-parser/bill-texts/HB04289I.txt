|  _Sec._ ___300.0151._ _____MANDATORY PAYMENTS. (a) Except as provided_  
| _by Subsection (e), if the governing body of a local jurisdiction_  
| _authorizes a health care provider participation program under this_  
| _chapter, the governing body shall require an annual mandatory_  
| _payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each_  
| _institutional health care provider located in the local_  
| _jurisdiction. The governing body of the local jurisdiction shall_  
| _provide that the mandatory payment is to be collected at least_  
| _annually, but not more often than quarterly. In the first year in_  
| _which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is_  
| _assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care_  
| _provider located in the local jurisdiction as determined by the_  
| _data reported to the Department of State Health Services under_  
| _Sections 311.032 and 311.033 in the most recent fiscal year for_  
| _which that data was reported. If the institutional health care_  
| _provider did not report any data under those sections, the_  
| _provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as_  
| _contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the_  
| _previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for_  
| _which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report. The local_  
| _jurisdiction shall update the amount of the mandatory payment on an_  
| _annual basis._  
|  _(b)_ _____The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this_  
| _chapter for a local jurisdiction must be uniformly proportionate_  
| _with the amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying_  
| _hospital in the local jurisdiction as permitted under federal law._  
| _A health care provider participation program authorized under this_  
| _chapter may not hold harmless any institutional health care_  
| _provider, as required under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w)._  
|  _(c)_ _____The governing body of a local jurisdiction that_  
| _authorizes a program under this chapter shall set the amount of the_  
| _mandatory payment. The aggregate amount of the mandatory payments_  
| _required of all paying providers in the local jurisdiction may not_  
| _exceed six percent of the aggregate net patient revenue from_  
| _hospital services provided by all paying providers in the local_  
| _jurisdiction._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to Subsection (c), if the governing body of a_  
| _local jurisdiction requires a mandatory payment authorized under_  
| _this chapter, the governing body shall set the mandatory payments_  
| _in amounts that in the aggregate will generate sufficient revenue_  
| _to cover the administrative expenses of the district for activities_  
| _under this chapter and to fund an intergovernmental transfer_  
| _described by Section 300.103(b)(1). The annual amount of revenue_  
| _from mandatory payments that shall be paid for administrative_  
| _expenses by the local jurisdiction is not to exceed $150,000, plus_  
| _the cost of collateralization of deposits, regardless of actual_  
| _expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _____A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient._  
|  _(f)_ _____A mandatory payment under this chapter is not a tax for_  
| _purposes of Section 5(a), Article IX, Texas Constitution._  
|  _Sec._ ___300.0152._ _____ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF MANDATORY_  
| _PAYMENTS. (a) The local jurisdiction may designate an official of_  
| _the local jurisdiction or contract with another person to assess_  
| _and collect the mandatory payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____The person charged by the local jurisdiction with the_  
| _assessment and collection of mandatory payments shall charge and_  
| _deduct from the mandatory payments collected for the local_  
| _jurisdiction a collection fee in an amount not to exceed the_  
| _person's usual and customary charges for like services._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the person charged with the assessment and collection_  
| _of mandatory payments is an official of the local jurisdiction, any_  
| _revenue from a collection fee charged under Subsection (b) shall be_  
| _deposited in the local jurisdiction general fund and, if_  
| _appropriate, shall be reported as fees of the local jurisdiction._  
|  _Sec._ ___300.0153._ _____CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE. (a) This chapter does not authorize a local_  
| _jurisdiction to collect mandatory payments for the purpose of_  
| _raising general revenue or any amount in excess of the amount_  
| _reasonably necessary to fund the nonfederal share of a Medicaid_  
| _supplemental payment program or Medicaid managed care rate_  
| _enhancements for nonpublic hospitals and to cover the_  
| _administrative expenses of the local jurisdiction associated with_  
| _activities under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the local jurisdiction_  
| _may provide by rule or order for an alternative provision or_  
| _procedure that conforms to the requirements of the federal Centers_  
| _for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A rule or order adopted under_  
| _this section may not create, impose, or materially expand the legal_  
| _or financial liability or responsibility of the local jurisdiction_  
| _or an institutional health care provider in the local jurisdiction_  
| _beyond the provisions of this chapter. This section does not_  
| _require the governing body of a local jurisdiction to adopt a rule_  
| _or order._  
|  _(c)_ _____The local jurisdiction may only assess and collect a_  
| _mandatory payment authorized under this chapter if a waiver_  
| _program, uniform rate enhancement, or reimbursement described by_  
| _Section 300.103(b)(1) is available to the local jurisdiction._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

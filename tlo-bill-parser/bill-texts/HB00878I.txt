| value of the property and the amount computed under Subsection  
| (a)(2).  
|  (c) The limitation provided by Subsection (a) takes effect  
| _on January 1 of the tax year following the first tax year in which_

| _by Subsection (c-1) or (c-2), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] limitation expires on  
| January 1 of the first tax year _following the year in which_ [ ~~that~~  
|  ~~neither~~ ] the owner of the property _ceases to own the property._  
|  _(c-1)_ _____If property subject to a limitation under this section_  
| _qualifies for an exemption under Section 11.13 when the ownership_  
| _of the property is transferred to the owner's spouse or surviving_  
| _spouse, the limitation expires on January 1 of the first tax year_  
| _following the year in which_ [ ~~when the limitation took effect nor~~ ]  
| the owner's spouse or surviving spouse _ceases to own the property,_  
| _unless the limitation is further continued under this subsection on_

| _before the 2019 tax year is considered to have acquired the property_  
| _on January 1, 2019; and_

| purposes to 105 percent or more of the appraised value of the  
| property for the preceding tax year is approved by the voters. If  
| that amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no

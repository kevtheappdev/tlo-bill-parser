| permit for a _new facility or modification of an existing facility_  
| _that belongs to Standard Industrial Classification Code 3273_  
| _(Ready-Mixed Concrete),_ [ ~~permanent concrete plant~~ ] that performs  
| wet batching, dry batching, or central mixing _,_ and that meets the  
| following requirements:  
|  (1) production records must be maintained on site  
| while the _facility_ [ ~~plant~~ ] is in operation until the second  
| anniversary of the end of the period to which they relate;  
|  (2) each cement or fly ash storage silo and weigh  
| hopper must be equipped with a fabric or cartridge filter or vented  
| to a fabric or cartridge filter system;  
|  (3) each fabric or cartridge filter, fabric or  
| cartridge filter system, and suction shroud must be maintained and  
| operated properly with no tears or leaks;  
|  (4) excluding the suction shroud filter system, each  
| filter system must be designed to meet a standard of at least 0.01  
| outlet grain loading as measured in grains per dry standard cubic  
| foot;  
|  (5) each filter system and each mixer loading and  
| batch truck loading emissions control device must meet a  
| performance standard of no visible emissions exceeding 30 seconds  
| in a five-minute period as determined using United States  
| Environmental Protection Agency Test Method 22 as that method  
| existed on September 1, 2003;  
|  (6) if a cement or fly ash silo is filled during  
| nondaylight hours, the silo filter system exhaust must be  
| sufficiently illuminated to enable a determination of compliance  
| with the performance standard described by Subdivision (5);  
|  (7) the conveying system for the transfer of cement or  
| fly ash to and from each storage silo must be totally enclosed,  
| operate properly, and be maintained without any tears or leaks;  
|  (8) except during cement or fly ash tanker connection  
| or disconnection, each conveying system for the transfer of cement  
| or fly ash must meet the performance standard described by  
| Subdivision (5);  
|  (9) a warning device must be installed on each bulk  
| storage silo to alert the operator in sufficient time for the  
| operator to stop loading operations before the silo is filled to a  
| level that may adversely affect the pollution abatement equipment;  
|  (10) if filling a silo results in failure of the  
| pollution abatement system or failure to meet the performance  
| standard described by Subdivision (5), the failure must be  
| documented and reported to the commission;  
|  (11) each road, parking lot, or other area at the  
| _facility_ [ ~~plant~~ ] site that is used by vehicles must be paved with a  
| cohesive hard surface that is properly maintained, cleaned, and  
| watered so as to minimize dust emissions;  
|  (12) each stockpile must be sprinkled with water or  
| dust-suppressant chemicals or covered so as to minimize dust  
| emissions;  
|  (13) material used in the batch that is spilled must be  
| immediately cleaned up and contained or dampened so as to minimize  
| dust emissions;  
|  (14) production of concrete at the _facility_ [ ~~plant~~ ]  
| must not exceed 300 cubic yards per hour;  
|  (15) a suction shroud or other pickup device must be  
| installed at the batch drop point or, in the case of a central mix  
| _facility_ [ ~~plant~~ ], at the drum feed and vented to a fabric or  
| cartridge filter system with a minimum capacity of 5,000 cubic feet  
| per minute of air;  
|  (16) the bag filter and capture system must be  
| properly designed to accommodate the increased flow from the  
| suction shroud and achieve a control efficiency of at least 99.5  
| percent;  
|  (17) the suction shroud baghouse exhaust must be  
| located more than 100 feet from any property line;  
|  (18) stationary equipment, stockpiles, and vehicles

| vehicles as they enter and exit the site, must be located or  
| operated more than 100 feet from any property line; and  
|  (19) the central baghouse must be located at least 440  
| yards from any building used as a single or multifamily residence,

| located in an area that is not subject to municipal zoning  
| regulation.  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Subsection (a)(18), the commission  
| shall issue a standard permit for a [ ~~permanent~~ ] concrete _facility_

| and:  
|  (1) each road, parking lot, and other traffic area

|  SECTION 4. The heading to Section 382.058, Health and

| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect on the date of filing, and that law is continued in effect

|  AN ACT  
| relating to prohibiting the operation of concrete plants and  
| crushing facilities at certain locations.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 382.05198(a), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commission shall issue a standard permit for a  
| permanent concrete plant that performs wet batching, dry batching,  
| or central mixing and that meets the following requirements:  
|  (1) production records must be maintained on site  
| while the plant is in operation until the second anniversary of the  
| end of the period to which they relate;  
|  (2) each cement or fly ash storage silo and weigh  
| hopper must be equipped with a fabric or cartridge filter or vented  
| to a fabric or cartridge filter system;  
|  (3) each fabric or cartridge filter, fabric or  
| cartridge filter system, and suction shroud must be maintained and  
| operated properly with no tears or leaks;  
|  (4) excluding the suction shroud filter system, each  
| filter system must be designed to meet a standard of at least 0.01  
| outlet grain loading as measured in grains per dry standard cubic  
| foot;  
|  (5) each filter system and each mixer loading and  
| batch truck loading emissions control device must meet a  
| performance standard of no visible emissions exceeding 30 seconds  
| in a five-minute period as determined using United States  
| Environmental Protection Agency Test Method 22 as that method  
| existed on September 1, 2003;  
|  (6) if a cement or fly ash silo is filled during  
| nondaylight hours, the silo filter system exhaust must be  
| sufficiently illuminated to enable a determination of compliance  
| with the performance standard described by Subdivision (5);  
|  (7) the conveying system for the transfer of cement or  
| fly ash to and from each storage silo must be totally enclosed,  
| operate properly, and be maintained without any tears or leaks;  
|  (8) except during cement or fly ash tanker connection  
| or disconnection, each conveying system for the transfer of cement  
| or fly ash must meet the performance standard described by  
| Subdivision (5);  
|  (9) a warning device must be installed on each bulk  
| storage silo to alert the operator in sufficient time for the  
| operator to stop loading operations before the silo is filled to a  
| level that may adversely affect the pollution abatement equipment;  
|  (10) if filling a silo results in failure of the  
| pollution abatement system or failure to meet the performance  
| standard described by Subdivision (5), the failure must be  
| documented and reported to the commission;  
|  (11) each road, parking lot, or other area at the plant  
| site that is used by vehicles must be paved with a cohesive hard  
| surface that is properly maintained, cleaned, and watered so as to  
| minimize dust emissions;  
|  (12) each stockpile must be sprinkled with water or  
| dust-suppressant chemicals or covered so as to minimize dust  
| emissions;  
|  (13) material used in the batch that is spilled must be  
| immediately cleaned up and contained or dampened so as to minimize  
| dust emissions;  
|  (14) production of concrete at the plant must not  
| exceed 300 cubic yards per hour;  
|  (15) a suction shroud or other pickup device must be  
| installed at the batch drop point or, in the case of a central mix  
| plant, at the drum feed and vented to a fabric or cartridge filter  
| system with a minimum capacity of 5,000 cubic feet per minute of  
| air;  
|  (16) the bag filter and capture system must be  
| properly designed to accommodate the increased flow from the  
| suction shroud and achieve a control efficiency of at least 99.5  
| percent;  
|  (17) the suction shroud baghouse exhaust must be  
| located more than 100 feet from any property line;  
|  (18) stationary equipment, stockpiles, and vehicles  
| used at the plant, except for incidental traffic and vehicles as  
| they enter and exit the site, must be located or operated more than  
| 100 feet from any property line; and  
|  (19) the central baghouse must be located at least _880_  
| [ ~~440~~ ] yards from any building used as a single or multifamily  
| residence, school, or place of worship at the time the application  
| to use the permit is filed with the commission if the plant is  
| located in an area that is not subject to municipal zoning  
| regulation.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 382.058(c), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) For purposes of this section, only those persons  
| actually residing in a permanent residence within _880_ [ ~~440~~ ] yards  
| of the proposed plant may request a hearing under Section 382.056 as  
| a person who may be affected.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 382.065(a) and (b), Health and Safety  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commission by rule shall prohibit the operation of a  
| concrete crushing facility within _880_ [ ~~440~~ ] yards of a building in  
| use as a single or multifamily residence, school, or place of  
| worship at the time the application for a permit to operate the  
| facility at a site near the residence, school, or place of worship  
| is filed with the commission. The measurement of distance for  
| purposes of this subsection shall be taken from the point on the  
| concrete crushing facility that is nearest to the residence,  
| school, or place of worship toward the point on the residence,  
| school, or place of worship that is nearest the concrete crushing  
| facility.  
|  (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a concrete crushing  
| facility:  
|  (1) at a location for which commission authorization  
| for the operation of a concrete crushing facility was in effect on  
| September 1, 2001;  
|  (2) at a location that satisfies the distance  
| requirements of Subsection (a) at the time the application for the  
| initial authorization for the operation of that facility at that  
| location is filed with the commission, provided that the  
| authorization is granted and maintained, regardless of whether a  
| single or multifamily residence, school, or place of worship is  
| subsequently built or put to use within _880_ [ ~~440~~ ] yards of the  
| facility; or  
|  (3) that:  
|  (A) uses a concrete crusher:  
|  (i) in the manufacture of products that  
| contain recycled materials; and  
|  (ii) that is located in an enclosed  
| building; and  
|  (B) is located:  
|  (i) within 25 miles of an international  
| border; and  
|  (ii) in a municipality with a population of  
| not less than 6,100 but not more than 20,000.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an application for a permit to operate a concrete plant or  
| crushing facility that is filed on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. An application for a permit filed before the effective  
| date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date of  
| filing, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

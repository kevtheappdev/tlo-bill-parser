|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Articles 55.01(a), (b), and (c), Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) A person who has been placed under a custodial or  
| noncustodial arrest for commission of either a felony or  
| misdemeanor is entitled to have all records and files relating to  
| the arrest expunged if:  
|  (1) the person is tried for the offense for which the  
| person was arrested and is:  
|  (A) acquitted by the trial court[ ~~, except as~~  
|  ~~provided by Subsection (c)~~ ]; or  
|  (B) convicted and subsequently:  
|  (i) pardoned for a reason other than that  
| described by Subparagraph (ii); or  
|  (ii) pardoned or otherwise granted relief  
| on the basis of actual innocence with respect to that offense, if  
| the applicable pardon or court order clearly indicates on its face  
| that the pardon or order was granted or rendered on the basis of the  
| person's actual innocence; or  
|  (2) the person has been released and the charge, if  
| any, has not resulted in a final conviction and is no longer pending  
| and there was no court-ordered community supervision under Chapter  
| 42A for the offense, unless the offense is a Class C misdemeanor,  
| provided that:  
|  (A) regardless of whether any statute of  
| limitations exists for the offense and whether any limitations  
| period for the offense has expired, an indictment _,_ [ ~~or~~ ]  
| information _, or complaint_ charging the person with the commission  
| of a misdemeanor offense based on the person's arrest or charging  
| the person with the commission of any felony offense arising out of  
| the same transaction for which the person was arrested:  
|  (i) has not been presented against the  
| person at any time following the arrest, and:  
|  (a) at least 180 days have elapsed  
| from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was  
| sought was for an offense punishable as a Class C misdemeanor and if  
| there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for  
| which the person was arrested;  
|  (b) at least one year has elapsed from  
| the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought  
| was for an offense punishable as a Class B or A misdemeanor and if  
| there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for  
| which the person was arrested;  
|  (c) at least three years have elapsed  
| from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was  
| sought was for an offense punishable as a felony or if there was a  
| felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the  
| person was arrested; or  
|  (d) the attorney representing the  
| state certifies that the applicable arrest records and files are  
| not needed for use in any criminal investigation or prosecution,  
| including an investigation or prosecution of another person; or  
|  (ii) if presented at any time following the  
| arrest, was dismissed or quashed, and the court finds that the  
| indictment _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] information _, or complaint_ was dismissed or
quashed  
| because:  
|  (a) the person completed a veterans  
| treatment court program created under Chapter 124, Government Code,  
| or former law, subject to Subsection (a-3);  
|  (b) the person completed a pretrial  
| intervention program authorized under Section 76.011, Government  
| Code, other than a veterans treatment court program created under  
| Chapter 124, Government Code, or former law;  
|  (c) the presentment had been made  
| because of mistake, false information, or other similar reason  
| indicating absence of probable cause at the time of the dismissal to  
| believe the person committed the offense; or  
|  (d) the indictment _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] information _,_  
| _or complaint_ was void; or  
|  (B) prosecution of the person for the offense for  
| which the person was arrested is no longer possible because the  
| limitations period has expired.  
|  (b) _Subject_ [ ~~Except as provided by Subsection (c) and~~  
|  ~~subject~~ ] to Subsection (b-1), a district court, a justice court, or  
| a municipal court of record may expunge all records and files  
| relating to the arrest of a person under the procedure established  
| under Article 55.02 if:  
|  (1) the person is:  
|  (A) tried for the offense for which the person  
| was arrested;  
|  (B) convicted of the offense; and  
|  (C) acquitted by the court of criminal appeals  
| or, if the period for granting a petition for discretionary review  
| has expired, by a court of appeals; or  
|  (2) an office of the attorney representing the state  
| authorized by law to prosecute the offense for which the person was  
| arrested recommends the expunction to the court before the person  
| is tried for the offense, regardless of whether an indictment _,_ [ ~~or~~ ]  
| information _, or complaint_ has been presented against the person in  
| relation to the offense.  
|  (c) _Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a_  
| [ ~~A~~ ] court may not order the expunction of records and files relating  
| to an arrest [ ~~for an offense for which a person is subsequently~~  
|  ~~acquitted, whether by the trial court, a court of appeals, or the~~  
|  ~~court of criminal appeals,~~ ] if the offense for which the person was  
| _arrested_ [ ~~acquitted~~ ] arose out of a criminal episode, as defined by  
| Section 3.01, Penal Code, and the person was convicted of or remains  
| subject to prosecution for at least one other offense occurring  
| during the criminal episode.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 2(a) and (a-1), Article 55.02, Code of

| is entitled to expunction of records and files under Article  
| 55.01(a)(1)(A), 55.01(a)(1)(B)(i), or 55.01(a)(2) or a person who  
| is eligible for expunction of records and files under Article

| court for the county in which:  
|  (1) the petitioner was arrested; or  
|  (2) the offense was alleged to have occurred.  
|  (a-1) _Except as provided by Subsection (e), if_ [ ~~If~~ ] the

| by fine only[ ~~,~~ ] _and the_ [ ~~a~~ ] person [ ~~who~~ ] is entitled to
expunction  
| of records and files under Article 55.01(a) or [ ~~a person who is~~ ]  
| eligible for expunction of records and files under Article  
| 55.01(b) _,_ [ ~~may file~~ ] an ex parte petition for expunction _must be_

| arrested because the statute of limitations has not run and there is  
| reasonable cause to believe that the state may proceed against the  
| person for the offense, the court may provide in its expunction  
| order that the law enforcement agency and the prosecuting attorney  
| responsible for investigating the offense may retain any records  
| and files that are necessary to the investigation.

| subsequent investigation and prosecution of a person other than the  
| person who is the subject of the expunction order; or  
|  (2) the state establishes that the records and files  
| are necessary for use in:  
|  (A) another criminal case, including a

| 55.04 apply to files and records retained under this section.

| _criminal episode, as defined by Section 3.01, Penal Code,_

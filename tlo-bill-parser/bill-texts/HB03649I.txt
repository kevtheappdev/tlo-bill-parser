| _the board of a district authorizes a health care provider_  
| _participation program under this chapter, the board may require an_  
| _annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue_  
| _of each institutional health care provider located in the district._ __  
| _The board may provide for the mandatory payment to be assessed_  
| _quarterly._ ___In the first year in which the mandatory payment is_  
| _required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient_  
| _revenue of an institutional health care provider as determined by_  
| _the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under_  
| _Sections 311.032 and 311.033 in the most recent fiscal year for_  
| _which that data was reported. If the institutional health care_  
| _provider did not report any data under those sections, the_  
| _provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as_  
| _contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the_  
| _previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for_  
| _which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report._ ___If the_  
| _mandatory payment is required, the district shall update the amount_  
| _of the mandatory payment on an annual basis._  
|  _(b)_ _____The amount of a mandatory payment assessed under this_  
| _chapter by the board of a district must be uniformly proportionate_  
| _with the amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying_  
| _provider in the district as permitted under federal law. A health_  
| _care provider participation program authorized under this chapter_  
| _may not hold harmless any institutional health care provider_  
| _located in the district, as required under 42 U.S.C. Section_  
| _1396b(w)._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the board of a district requires a mandatory payment_  
| _authorized under this chapter, the board shall set the amount of the_  
| _mandatory payment, subject to the limitations of this chapter._ ___The_  
| _aggregate amount of the mandatory payments required of all paying_  
| _providers in the district may not exceed six percent of the_  
| _aggregate net patient revenue from hospital services provided by_  
| _all paying providers in the district._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to Subsection (c), if the board of a district_  
| _requires a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter, the_  
| _board shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the_  
| _aggregate will generate sufficient revenue to cover the_  
| _administrative expenses of the district for activities under this_  
| _chapter and to fund an intergovernmental transfer described by_  
| _Section 298E.103(c)(1). The annual amount of revenue from_  
| _mandatory payments that shall be paid for administrative expenses_  
| _by the district is $150,000, plus the cost of collateralization of_  
| _deposits, regardless of actual expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _____A paying provider may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient._  
|  _(f)_ _____A mandatory payment assessed under this chapter is not a_

| _PAYMENTS. (a)_ ___A district may designate an official of the district_  
| _or contract with another person to assess and collect the mandatory_  
| _payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____The person charged by the district with the assessment_  
| _and collection of mandatory payments shall charge and deduct from_  
| _the mandatory payments collected for the district a collection fee_  
| _in an amount not to exceed the person's usual and customary charges_  
| _for like services._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the person charged with the assessment and collection_  
| _of mandatory payments is an official of the district, any revenue_  
| _from a collection fee charged under Subsection (b) shall be_  
| _deposited in the district general fund and, if appropriate, shall_  
| _be reported as fees of the district._  
|  _Sec._ ___298E.153._ _____PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE; LIMITATION OF AUTHORITY. (a) The purpose of this chapter_  
| _is to authorize a district to establish a program to enable the_  
| _district to collect mandatory payments from institutional health_  
| _care providers to fund the nonfederal share of a Medicaid_  
| _supplemental payment program or the Medicaid managed care rate_  
| _enhancements for nonpublic hospitals to support the provision of_  
| _health care by institutional health care providers located in the_  
| _district to district residents in need of health care._  
|  _(b)_ _____This chapter does not authorize a district to collect_  
| _mandatory payments for the purpose of raising general revenue or_  
| _any amount in excess of the amount reasonably necessary to fund the_  
| _nonfederal share of a Medicaid supplemental payment program or_  
| _Medicaid managed care rate enhancements for nonpublic hospitals and_  
| _to cover the administrative expenses of the district associated_  
| _with activities under this chapter._  
|  _(c)_ _____To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the board of a district_  
| _may provide by rule for an alternative provision or procedure that_  
| _conforms to the requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare_  
| _and Medicaid Services. A rule adopted under this section may not_  
| _create, impose, or materially expand the legal or financial_  
| _liability or responsibility of the district or an institutional_  
| _health care provider in the district beyond the provisions of this_  
| _chapter. This section does not require the board to adopt a rule._  
|  _(d)_ _____A district may only assess and collect a mandatory_  
| _payment authorized under this chapter if a waiver program, uniform_  
| _rate enhancement, or reimbursement described by Section_  
| _298E.103(c)(1) is available to the district._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  _(2)_ _____is eligible for Medicaid or the CHIP perinatal_  
| _program._  
|  _(c)_ _____The commission shall implement the automatic enrollment_  
| _in a manner that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____ensures a seamless transition in the provision of_  
| _services between the Healthy Texas Women program and Medicaid or_  
| _the CHIP perinatal program, as applicable; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____allows a woman to begin receiving services through_  
| _Medicaid or the CHIP perinatal program, as applicable, on the first_  
| _day the woman is enrolled in the program._  
|  _(d)_ _____The commission shall, at the time a woman is_  
| _automatically enrolled under Subsection (b) in Medicaid or the CHIP_  
| _perinatal program, as applicable:_

| _program, including the services provided under the program._  
|  _(e)_ _____The executive commissioner shall adopt rules necessary_  
| _to implement this section._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply to a  
| woman who is a recipient of medical assistance under Chapter 32,  
| Human Resources Code, benefits through the child health plan  
| program under Chapter 62, Health and Safety Code, or services  
| through the Healthy Texas Women program, on or after the effective  
| date of this Act, regardless of the date on which eligibility for  
| medical assistance, the child health plan program, or the Healthy  
| Texas Women program was determined.  
|  SECTION 3. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization, including  
| a state plan amendment, from a federal agency is necessary for  
| implementation of that provision, the agency affected by the  
| provision shall request the waiver or authorization and may delay  
| implementing that provision until the waiver or authorization is

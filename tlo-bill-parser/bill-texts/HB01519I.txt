|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to fees regarding a residential tenant's failure to timely  
| pay rent.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 92.019, Property Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (b), and (c) and adding Subsections (a-1)  
| and (a-2) to read as follows:  
|  (a) A landlord may not _collect from_ [ ~~charge~~ ] a tenant a late  
| fee for failing to pay _any portion of the tenant's_ rent unless:  
|  (1) notice of the fee is included in a written lease;  
|  (2) the fee is [ ~~a~~ ] reasonable _considering that_  
| [ ~~estimate of uncertain~~ ] damages _resulting from the late payment of_  
| _rent_ to the landlord [ ~~that~~ ] are incapable of precise calculation  
| and result from late payment of rent; and  
|  (3) _any portion of_ the rent has remained unpaid one  
| full day after the date the rent was originally due.  
|  _(a-1)_ _____To determine the damages described by Subsection_  
| _(a)(2), a landlord may consider any direct or indirect expenses_  
| _related to the tenant's late payment incurred by the landlord,_  
| _including direct or indirect costs, expenses, or overhead_  
| _associated with the landlord's process established to collect late_  
| _payments._  
|  _(a-2)_ _____A late fee collected from a tenant of an apartment_  
| _house complies with Subsection (a)(2) if the late fee does not_  
| _exceed the greater of $150 or ten percent of the amount of rent for_  
| _the rental pay period under the lease. For purposes of this_  
| _subsection, "apartment house" means a building that contains five_  
| _or more dwelling units._  
|  (b) A late fee under this section may include an initial fee  
| and a daily fee for each day _any portion of_ the rent continues to  
| remain unpaid _, and the combined fees are considered a single late_  
| _fee for purposes of this section_.  
|  (c) A landlord who violates this section is liable to the  
| tenant for an amount equal to the sum of $100, three times the  
| amount of the late fee _collected_ [ ~~charged~~ ] in violation of this  
| section, and the tenant's reasonable attorney's fees.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

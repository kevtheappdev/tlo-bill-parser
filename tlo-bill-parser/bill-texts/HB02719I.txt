|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 5.12(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) At the written request of the governing bodies of a  
| majority of the taxing units participating in an appraisal district  
| [ ~~or of a majority of the taxing units entitled to vote on the~~  
|  ~~appointment of appraisal district directors~~ ], the comptroller  
| shall audit the performance of the appraisal district. The  
| governing bodies may request a general audit of the performance of  
| the appraisal district or may request an audit of only one or more  
| particular duties, practices, functions, departments, or other  
| appraisal district matters.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 5.13(h), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (h) At any time after the request for an audit is made, the  
| comptroller may discontinue the audit in whole or in part if  
| requested to do so by:  
|  (1) the governing bodies of a majority of the taxing  
| units participating in the district, if the audit was requested by a  
| majority of those units; _or_  
|  (2) _the taxpayers who requested the audit,_ [ ~~the~~  
|  ~~governing bodies of a majority of the taxing units entitled to vote~~  
|  ~~on the appointment of appraisal district directors, if the audit~~  
|  ~~was requested by a majority of those units; or~~  
|  [ ~~(3)~~ ] if the audit was requested under Section 5.12(c)  
| [ ~~of this code, by the taxpayers who requested the audit~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Section 6.03, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a) and (l) and adding Subsection (a-1) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) The appraisal district is governed by a board of _five_  
| directors. _Each director is elected at large by the voters of the_  
| _county._ ___The_ [ ~~Five directors are appointed by the taxing units
that~~  
|  ~~participate in the district as provided by this section. If the~~  
|  ~~county assessor-collector is not appointed to the board, the~~ ]  
| county assessor-collector serves as a nonvoting director. The  
| county assessor-collector is ineligible to serve if the board  
| enters into a contract under Section 6.05(b) or if the  
| commissioners court of the county enters into a contract under  
| Section 6.24(b). _The directors other than the county_  
| _assessor-collector are elected at the general election for state_  
| _and county officers and serve two-year terms beginning on January 1_  
| _of odd-numbered years._ ___Candidacy for an election under this_  
| _section is governed by Chapter 144, Election Code._ ___A filing fee is_  
| _not required to become a candidate._  
|  _(a-1)_ To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an  
| individual other than _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] county assessor-collector [ ~~serving
as~~  
|  ~~a nonvoting director~~ ] must be a resident of the _county for which the_  
| _appraisal district is established_ [ ~~district~~ ] and [ ~~must~~ ] have  
| resided in the _appraisal_ district for at least two years  
| immediately preceding the date the individual takes office. [ ~~An~~  
|  ~~individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board is not~~  
|  ~~ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a taxing~~  
|  ~~unit. An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the~~  
|  ~~district is not eligible to serve on the board unless the individual~~  
|  ~~is also a member of the governing body or an elected official of a~~  
|  ~~taxing unit that participates in the district.~~ ]  
|  (l) _A_ [ ~~If a~~ ] vacancy [ ~~occurs~~ ] on the board of directors  
| other than a vacancy in the position held by _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] county  
| assessor-collector _is filled for the remainder of the unexpired_  
| _term by appointment by a majority of the remaining directors._ ___A_  
| _person appointed to fill a vacancy on the board of directors must_  
| _meet the qualifications of the vacated position_ [ ~~serving as a~~  
|  ~~nonvoting director, each taxing unit that is entitled to vote by~~  
|  ~~this section may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing~~  
|  ~~body a candidate to fill the vacancy. The unit shall submit the~~  
|  ~~name of its nominee to the chief appraiser within 45 days after~~  
|  ~~notification from the board of directors of the existence of the~~  
|  ~~vacancy, and the chief appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the~~  
|  ~~board of directors within the next five days a list of the nominees.~~  
|  ~~The board of directors shall elect by majority vote of its members~~  
|  ~~one of the nominees to fill the vacancy~~ ].  
|  SECTION 4. Section 6.036(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) An individual is not eligible to be _a candidate for, to_  
| _be_ appointed to _,_ or to serve on the board of directors of an  
| appraisal district if the individual or a business entity in which  
| the individual has a substantial interest is a party to a contract  
| with:  
|  (1) the appraisal district; or  
|  (2) a taxing unit that participates in the appraisal  
| district, if the contract relates to the performance of an activity  
| governed by this title.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 6.051(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) The acquisition or conveyance of real property or the  
| construction or renovation of a building or other improvement by an  
| appraisal district must be approved by the governing bodies of  
| three-fourths of the taxing units _that participate in the district_  
| [ ~~entitled to vote on the appointment of board members~~ ]. The board  
| of directors by resolution may propose a property transaction or  
| other action for which this subsection requires approval of the  
| taxing units. The chief appraiser shall notify the presiding  
| officer of each governing body entitled to vote on the approval of  
| the proposal by delivering a copy of the board's resolution,  
| together with information showing the costs of other available  
| alternatives to the proposal. On or before the 30th day after the  
| date the presiding officer receives notice of the proposal, the  
| governing body of a taxing unit by resolution may approve or  
| disapprove the proposal. If a governing body fails to act on or  
| before that 30th day or fails to file its resolution with the chief  
| appraiser on or before the 10th day after that 30th day, the  
| proposal is treated as if it were disapproved by the governing body.  
|  SECTION 6. Sections 6.06(a), (b), and (i), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Each year the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed  
| budget for the operations of the district for the following tax year  
| and shall submit copies to each taxing unit participating in the  
| district and to the district board of directors before June 15. _The_  
| _chief appraiser_ [ ~~He~~ ] shall include in the budget a list showing each  
| proposed position, the proposed salary for the position, all  
| benefits proposed for the position, each proposed capital  
| expenditure, and an estimate of the amount of the budget that will  
| be allocated to each taxing unit. Each taxing unit _that_  
| _participates in the district_ [ ~~entitled to vote on the appointment~~  
|  ~~of board members~~ ] shall maintain a copy of the proposed budget for  
| public inspection at its principal administrative office.  
|  (b) The board of directors shall hold a public hearing to  
| consider the budget. The secretary of the board shall deliver to  
| the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit  
| participating in the district not later than the 10th day before the  
| date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and place  
| fixed for the hearing. The board shall complete its hearings, make  
| any amendments to the proposed budget it desires, and finally  
| approve a budget before September 15. If governing bodies of a  
| majority of the taxing units _participating in the district_  
| [ ~~entitled to vote on the appointment of board members~~ ] adopt  
| resolutions disapproving a budget and file them with the secretary  
| of the board within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not  
| take effect, and the board shall adopt a new budget within 30 days  
| of the disapproval.  
|  (i) The fiscal year of an appraisal district is the calendar  
| year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing  
| units _participating in the district_ [ ~~entitled to vote on the~~  
|  ~~appointment of board members~~ ] adopt resolutions proposing a  
| different fiscal year and file them with the secretary of the board  
| not more than 12 and not less than eight months before the first day  
| of the fiscal year proposed by the resolutions. If the fiscal year  
| of an appraisal district is changed under this subsection, the  
| chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year  
| as provided by Subsection (a) [ ~~of this section~~ ] before the 15th day  
| of the seventh month preceding the first day of the fiscal year  
| established by the change, and the board of directors shall adopt a  
| budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (b) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ] before the 15th day of the fourth month preceding the first  
| day of the fiscal year established by the change. Unless the  
| appraisal district adopts a different method of allocation under  
| Section 6.061 [ ~~of this code~~ ], the allocation of the budget to each  
| taxing unit shall be calculated as provided by Subsection (d) of  
| this section using the amount of property taxes imposed by each  
| participating taxing unit in the most recent tax year preceding the  
| fiscal year established by the change for which the necessary  
| information is available. Each taxing unit shall pay its  
| allocation as provided by Subsection (e) [ ~~of this section~~ ], except  
| that the first payment shall be made before the first day of the  
| fiscal year established by the change and subsequent payments shall  
| be made quarterly. In the year in which a change in the fiscal year  
| occurs, the budget that takes effect on January 1 of that year may  
| be amended as necessary as provided by Subsection (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ] in order to accomplish the change in fiscal years.  
|  SECTION 7. Sections 6.061(b) and (e), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) The taxing units participating in an appraisal district  
| may adopt a different method of allocating the costs of operating  
| the district if the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing  
| units that _participate in the district_ [ ~~are entitled to vote on the~~  
|  ~~appointment of board members~~ ] adopt resolutions providing for the  
| other method. However, a change under this subsection is not valid  
| if it requires any taxing unit to pay a greater proportion of the  
| appraisal district's costs than the unit would pay under Section  
| 6.06 [ ~~of this code~~ ] without the consent of the governing body of  
| that unit.  
|  (e) A change in allocation of district costs made as  
| provided by this section remains in effect until changed in a manner  
| provided by this section or rescinded by resolution of a majority of  
| the governing bodies _of the taxing units that participate in the_  
| _district_ [ ~~that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members~~  
|  ~~under Section 6.03 of this code~~ ].  
|  SECTION 8. Section 6.063(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) The report of the audit is a public record. A copy of  
| the report shall be delivered to the presiding officer of the  
| governing body of each taxing unit _that participates in the_  
| _district_ [ ~~eligible to vote on the appointment of district~~  
|  ~~directors~~ ], and a reasonable number of copies shall be available  
| for inspection at the appraisal office.  
|  SECTION 9. Section 6.15(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to a routine  
| communication between the chief appraiser and the county  
| assessor-collector that relates to the administration of an  
| appraisal roll, including a communication made in connection with  
| the certification, correction, or collection of an account,  
| regardless of whether the county assessor-collector _serves on_ [ ~~was~~  
|  ~~appointed to~~ ] the board of directors of the appraisal district [
~~or~~  
|  ~~serves as a nonvoting director~~ ].  
|  SECTION 10. The following provisions of the Tax Code are  
| repealed:  
|  (1) Sections 6.03(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),  
| (i), (j), and (k);

| Act, beginning with the general election for state and county  
| officers conducted in 2020. Members then elected take office  
| January 1, 2021.  
|  (b) The change in the manner of selection of appraisal  
| district directors made by this Act does not affect the selection of  
| directors who serve on the board before January 1, 2021.  
|  (c) The term of an appraisal district director serving on  
| December 31, 2020, expires on January 1, 2021.

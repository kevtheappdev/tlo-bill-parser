| done by a repair facility recognized by the Department of Public  
| Safety, which may be an independent or private entity licensed by  
| the state; and

| _incentive_ [ ~~assistance, retrofit, and accelerated vehicle~~  
|  ~~retirement~~ ] program established and implemented under this  
| section.  
|  (g) A participating county may contract with any  
| appropriate entity, including the regional council of governments  
| or the metropolitan planning organization in the appropriate  
| region, or with another county for services necessary to implement

| attributable to a [ ~~low-income~~ ] vehicle repair _and replacement_  
| _incentive_ [ ~~assistance, retrofit, and accelerated vehicle~~  
|  ~~retirement~~ ] program in a county that are attained during a period  
| before the county is designated as a nonattainment county shall be  
| considered emissions reductions credit if the county is later  
| determined to be a nonattainment county.  
|  (i) Notwithstanding the vehicle replacement requirements  
| provided by Subsection (d)(2), the commission by rule may provide  
| monetary or other compensatory assistance under the [ ~~low-income~~ ]

| [ ~~assistance, retrofit, and accelerated vehicle retirement~~ ] program  
| for a replacement vehicle or replacement assistance for a pre-1996  
| model year replacement vehicle that passes the required United  
| States Environmental Protection Agency Start-Up Acceleration  
| Simulation Mode Standards emissions test but that would have failed  
| the United States Environmental Protection Agency Final  
| Acceleration Simulation Mode Standards emissions test or failed to  
| meet some other criterion determined by the commission; provided,  
| however, that a replacement vehicle under this subsection must be a  
| qualifying motor vehicle.

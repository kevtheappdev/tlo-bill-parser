| _requirements, and other circumstances of the district's funds or_  
| _funds under its control then prevailing, taking into consideration_

|  (e) An independent school district subject to this section  
| may purchase, sell, and invest its funds and funds under its control  
| in corporate bonds _or other kinds of investments authorized by_

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the requirements for meetings of certain special  
| districts.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 551.128(b-1), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b-1) A transit authority or department subject to Chapter  
| 451, 452, 453, or 460, Transportation Code, an elected school  
| district board of trustees for a school district that has a student  
| enrollment of 10,000 or more, an elected governing body of a  
| home-rule municipality that has a population of 50,000 or more, _a_  
| _governing body of a special district subject to Chapter 51, 53, 54,_  
| _or 55, Water Code, that has a population of 500 or more,_ or a county  
| commissioners court for a county that has a population of 125,000 or  
| more shall:  
|  (1) make a video and audio recording of reasonable  
| quality of each:  
|  (A) regularly scheduled open meeting that is not  
| a work session or a special called meeting; and  
|  (B) open meeting that is a work session or  
| special called meeting if:  
|  (i) the governmental body is an elected  
| school district board of trustees for a school district that has a  
| student enrollment of 10,000 or more; and  
|  (ii) at the work session or special called  
| meeting, the board of trustees votes on any matter or allows public  
| comment or testimony; and  
|  (2) make available an archived copy of the video and  
| audio recording of each meeting described by Subdivision (1) on the  
| Internet.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 49.062, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (c) and adding Subsection (e) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) _Except as provided by Subsection (e), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] board  
| shall designate one or more places inside or outside the district  
| for conducting the meetings of the board. The meeting place may be  
| a private residence or office, provided that the board, in its order  
| establishing the meeting place, declares the same to be a public  
| place and invites the public to attend any meeting of the board. If  
| the board establishes a meeting place or places outside the  
| district, it shall give notice of the location or locations by  
| filing a true copy of the resolution establishing the location or  
| locations of the meeting place or places with the commission and  
| also by publishing notice of the location or locations in a  
| newspaper of general circulation in the district. If the location  
| of any of the meeting places outside the district is changed, notice  
| of the change shall be given in the same manner.  
|  (c) _Except as provided by Subsection (e), after_ [ ~~After~~ ] at  
| least 25 qualified electors are residing in a district, on written  
| request of at least five of those electors, the board shall  
| designate a meeting place and hold meetings within the district if  
| it determines that the meeting place used by the district deprives  
| the residents of a reasonable opportunity to attend district  
| meetings. On the failure to designate the location of the meeting  
| place within the district, five electors may petition the  
| commission to designate a location. If it determines that the  
| meeting place used by the district deprives the residents of a  
| reasonable opportunity to attend district meetings, the commission  
| may designate a meeting place inside or outside the district which  
| is reasonably available to the public and require that the meetings  
| be held at such place. After the next election, the board may  
| designate different meeting places, including one located outside  
| the boundaries of the district.  
|  _(e)_ _____This subsection applies to a district with a population_  
| _of 500 or more._ ___The board shall designate a place inside the_  
| _district for conducting the meetings of the board._ ___If the board is_  
| _unable to designate a suitable meeting place inside the district,_  
| _the board may designate a place outside the district that is located_  
| _not farther than 10 miles from the district's boundaries._  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an open meeting held on or after the effective date of this Act. An  
| open meeting that is held before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date of the open meeting, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

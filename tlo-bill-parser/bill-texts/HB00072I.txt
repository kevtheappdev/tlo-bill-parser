| _conservatorship of the Department of Family and Protective_  
| _Services; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____protect the continuity of care for each recipient_  
| _and, if applicable, ensure coordination between the STAR Health_  
| _Medicaid managed care program and any Medicaid managed care program_

| _will transition._  
|  SECTION 3. As soon as possible after the effective date of

| implementing this Act until the waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

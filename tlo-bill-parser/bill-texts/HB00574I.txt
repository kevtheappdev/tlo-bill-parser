| _for the housing, employment, or license._  
|  (d) For any defendant who receives a dismissal and discharge

| supervision for an offense committed on or after the effective date

| committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  For purposes of this section, an offense was committed  
| before the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense  
| was committed before that date.

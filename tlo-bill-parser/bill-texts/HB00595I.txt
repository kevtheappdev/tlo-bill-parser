|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
|  
| relating to making certain false alarms or reports because of bias  
| or prejudice; increasing a criminal penalty.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 42.014, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Subsection (a-1) to read as follows:  
|  _(a-1)_ _____In the trial of an offense under Section 42.06(a)(1),_  
| _Penal Code, the judge shall make an affirmative finding of fact and_  
| _enter the affirmative finding in the judgment of the case if at the_  
| _guilt or innocence phase of the trial, the judge or the jury,_  
| _whichever is the trier of fact, determines beyond a reasonable_  
| _doubt that the defendant:_  
|  _(1)_ _____committed the offense for the purpose of causing a_  
| _law enforcement agency to take action against another person; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____intentionally selected the person described by_  
| _Subdivision (1) because of the defendant's bias or prejudice_  
| _against a group identified by race, color, disability, religion,_  
| _national origin or ancestry, age, gender, or sexual preference or_  
| _by status as a peace officer or judge._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 12.47(a), Penal Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) If an affirmative finding under Article 42.014, Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, is made in the trial of an offense other than a  
| first degree felony or a Class A misdemeanor, the punishment for the  
| offense is increased to the punishment prescribed for the next  
| highest category of offense. If the offense is a Class A  
| misdemeanor, the minimum term of confinement for the offense is  
| increased to 180 days. This section does not apply to the trial of  
| an offense of injury to a disabled individual under Sec. 22.04, if  
| the affirmative finding in the case under Article _42.014(a)_  
| [ ~~42.014~~ ], Code of Criminal Procedure, shows that the defendant  
| intentionally selected the victim because the victim was disabled.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred  
| before that date.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

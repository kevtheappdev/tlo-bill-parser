| exemption for the applicable portion of that tax year immediately  
| on qualification for the exemption.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 11.43(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) An exemption provided by Section 11.13, 11.131, 11.132,  
| 11.133, 11.134, _11.136,_ 11.17, 11.18, 11.182, 11.1827, 11.183,

| otherwise provided by Subsection (e), the exemption applies to the  
| property until it changes ownership or the person's qualification

| Subsection (r), the chief appraiser may require a person allowed  
| one of the exemptions in a prior year to file a new application to  
| confirm the person's current qualification for the exemption by  
| delivering a written notice that a new application is required,  
| accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person  
| previously allowed the exemption. If the person previously allowed  
| the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief appraiser may  
| not cancel the exemption due to the person's failure to file the new  
| application unless the chief appraiser complies with the  
| requirements of Subsection (q), if applicable.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 26.10(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead  
| exemption under Section 11.131 _or 11.136_ applicable to a property  
| on January 1 of a year terminated during the year, the tax due  
| against the residence homestead is calculated by multiplying the  
| amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the residence  
| homestead for the entire year had the individual not qualified for  
| the _residence homestead_ exemption [ ~~under Section 11.131~~ ] during the  
| year by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the  
| numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the date  
| the exemption terminated.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 26.1125, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 26.1125. CALCULATION OF TAXES ON RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD  
| OF 100 PERCENT OR TOTALLY DISABLED VETERAN _OR UNPAID CAREGIVER_. (a)  
| If a person qualifies for an exemption under Section 11.131 _or_  
| _11.136_ after the beginning of a tax year, the amount of the taxes on  
| the residence homestead of the person for the tax year is calculated  
| by multiplying the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be  
| imposed on the residence homestead for the entire year had the  
| person not qualified for the _applicable_ exemption [ ~~under Section~~  
|  ~~11.131~~ ] by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the  
| numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed before the  
| date the person qualified for the _applicable_ exemption [ ~~under~~  
|  ~~Section 11.131~~ ].  
|  (b) If a person qualifies for an exemption under Section  
| 11.131 _or 11.136_ with respect to the property after the amount of  
| the tax due on the property is calculated and the effect of the  
| qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the  
| property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall recalculate the  
| amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll.  If  
| the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been  
| paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in  
| whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the person's  
| authorized agent.  If the tax on the property has been paid, the tax  
| collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the person who paid  
| the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 403.302(d-1), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (d-1) For purposes of Subsection (d), a residence homestead  
| that receives an exemption under Section 11.131, 11.133, [ ~~or~~ ]  
| 11.134, _or 11.136,_ Tax Code, in the year that is the subject of the  
| study is not considered to be taxable property.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 11.136, Tax Code, as added by this Act,  
| applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed for a tax year beginning on  
| or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 8. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to exempt from  
| ad valorem taxation the total assessed value of the residence  
| homestead of an unpaid caregiver of an individual who is eligible to  
| receive long-term services and supports under the Medicaid program  
| while the individual is on a waiting list for the services and  
| supports is approved by the voters. If that constitutional  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

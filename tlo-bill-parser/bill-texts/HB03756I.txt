|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the inclusion of affordable housing as a qualifying  
| project for public-private partnerships.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2267.001(10), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (10) "Qualifying project" means:  
|  (A) any ferry, mass transit facility, vehicle  
| parking facility, port facility, power generation facility, fuel  
| supply facility, oil or gas pipeline, water supply facility, public  
| work, waste treatment facility, hospital, school, medical or  
| nursing care facility, recreational facility, _affordable housing,_  
| public building, technology facility, or other similar facility  
| currently available or to be made available to a governmental  
| entity for public use, including any structure, parking area,  
| appurtenance, and other property required to operate the structure  
| or facility and any technology infrastructure installed in the  
| structure or facility that is essential to the project's purpose;  
| or  
|  (B) any improvements necessary or desirable to  
| real property owned by a governmental entity.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2267.002(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) there is a public need for timely acquisition,  
| design, construction, improvement, renovation, expansion,  
| equipping, maintenance, operation, implementation, and  
| installation of education facilities, _affordable housing,_  
| technology and other public infrastructure, and government  
| facilities in this state that serve a public need and purpose;  
|  (2) the public need may not be wholly satisfied by  
| existing methods of procurement in which qualifying projects are  
| acquired, designed, constructed, improved, renovated, expanded,  
| equipped, maintained, operated, implemented, or installed;  
|  (3) there are inadequate resources to develop new  
| education facilities, _affordable housing,_ technology and other  
| public infrastructure, and government facilities for the benefit of  
| the citizens of this state, and there is demonstrated evidence that  
| partnerships between public entities and private entities or other  
| persons can meet these needs by improving the schedule for  
| delivery, lowering the cost, and providing other benefits to the  
| public;  
|  (4) financial incentives exist under state and federal  
| tax provisions that encourage public entities to enter into  
| partnerships with private entities or other persons to develop  
| qualifying projects; and  
|  (5) authorizing private entities or other persons to  
| develop or operate one or more qualifying projects may serve the  
| public safety, benefit, and welfare by making the projects  
| available to the public in a more timely or less costly fashion.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 2267.001(10), Government Code, as  
| amended by this Act, applies only to a qualifying project for which  
| an agreement is entered into on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or a guest or invitee of  
| the tenant, either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the  
| lease by giving written notice to the other any time before repairs  
| are completed.

| _landlord's representative at another location; or_  
|  _(ii)_ _____by mail to the place where the tenant's_  
| _rent is normally paid; or_  
|  _(2) to a tenant:_  
|  _(A)_ _____by hand delivery or mail to a forwarding_  
| _address that the tenant provides to the landlord by e-mail or_  
| _otherwise; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____if a forwarding address has not been provided_  
| _as described by Paragraph (A):_  
|  _(i)_ _____by hand delivery to the tenant at_  
| _another location; or_

| _premises._  
|  _(b-2)_ _____A termination of a lease as authorized by Subsection_  
| _(b) may not take effect before the 15th day after the date the_  
| _notice is delivered. If more than one method under Subsection (b-1)_  
| _is used to provide notice, the method under which the notice was_  
| _delivered on the earliest date applies for purposes of this_  
| _subsection._  
|  _(b-3)_ _____A landlord may not charge rent for the rental premises_  
| _and rent for the rental premises may not accrue after the date the_  
| _premises became as a practical matter totally unusable for_  
| _residential purposes as a result of a casualty loss._  
|  _(b-4)_ _____Subject to Subsection (b-5) and notwithstanding that_  
| _the termination of the lease has not taken effect under Subsection_  
| _(b-2), if a notice to terminate_ [ ~~If~~ ] the lease is _provided under_  
| _this section_ [ ~~terminated~~ ], the _landlord shall pay to the_ tenant
_not_

| [ ~~otherwise required by law~~ ].  
|  _(b-5)_ _____If a tenant has not provided the landlord a forwarding_

| _under Subsection (b) may provide the written statement of the_  
| _tenant's forwarding address in that notice. A landlord that_

| _determine_ [ ~~in~~ ] an amount _that is_ proportionate to the extent the  
| premises are unusable because of the casualty _loss_ [ ~~, but only on~~

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the interest rate on a refund of ad valorem taxes made  
| following the final determination of an appeal that decreases a  
| property owner's tax liability.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 42.43, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (b), (b-1), and (c) and adding Subsection (b-2) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) _Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), for_ [ ~~For~~ ] a  
| refund made under this section, the taxing unit shall include with  
| the refund interest on the amount refunded calculated at an annual  
| rate of 9.5 percent, calculated from the delinquency date for the  
| taxes until the date the refund is made.  
|  (b-1) _For a refund made under this section resulting from_  
| _the final determination of an appeal that decreases a property_  
| _owner's liability for taxes imposed on a refinery, the taxing unit_  
| _shall include with the refund interest on the amount refunded_  
| _calculated at an annual rate that is equal to the auction average_  
| _rate quoted on a bank discount basis for one-month treasury bills_  
| _issued by the United States government, as published by the Federal_  
| _Reserve Board, for the week in which the taxes became delinquent,_  
| _but not more than 4 percent, calculated from the delinquency date_  
| _for the taxes until the date the refund is made. In this_  
| _subsection, "refinery" means an installation that refines, treats,_  
| _prepares, or processes raw or unrefined petroleum._  
|  _(b-2)_ A taxing unit may not send a refund made under this  
| section before the earlier of:  
|  (1) the 21st day after the final determination of the  
| appeal; or  
|  (2) the date the property owner files the form  
| prescribed by Subsection (i) with the taxing unit.  
|  (c) Notwithstanding _Subsections_ [ ~~Subsection~~ ] (b) _and (b-1)_  
| ,  
| if a taxing unit does not make a refund, including interest,  
| required by this section before the 60th day after the date the  
| chief appraiser certifies a correction to the appraisal roll under  
| Section 42.41, the taxing unit shall include with the refund  
| interest on the amount refunded at an annual rate of 12 percent,  
| calculated from the delinquency date for the taxes until the date  
| the refund is made. A refund is not considered made under this  
| section until sent to the proper person as provided by this section.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to interest that accrues on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| Interest that accrued before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect when the interest accrued, and that  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

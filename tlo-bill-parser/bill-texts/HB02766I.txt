|  SECTION 4. Section 481.074, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), (k),  
| and (q) and adding Subsections (b-1) and (b-2) to read as follows:  
|  (b) Except in an emergency as defined by _board_ rule _under_  
| _Subsection (b-1)_ [ ~~of the board~~ ] or as _otherwise_ provided by  
| [ ~~Subsection (o) or~~ ] Section 481.075(j) or (m) _or 481.0755_ , a person  
| may not dispense or administer a controlled substance [ ~~listed in~~  
|  ~~Schedule II without a written prescription of a practitioner on an~~  
|  ~~official prescription form or~~ ] without an electronic prescription  
| that meets the requirements of and is completed by the practitioner  
| in accordance with Section 481.075.  
|  _(b-1)_ In an emergency _as defined by board rule_ , a person may  
| dispense or administer a controlled substance [ ~~listed in Schedule~~  
|  ~~II~~ ] on the oral or telephonically communicated prescription of a  
| practitioner. The person who administers or dispenses the substance  
| shall:  
|  (1) if the person is a prescribing practitioner or a  
| pharmacist, promptly comply with Subsection (c); or  
|  (2) if the person is not a prescribing practitioner or  
| a pharmacist, promptly write the oral or telephonically  
| communicated prescription and include in the written record of the  
| prescription the name, address, and Federal Drug Enforcement  
| Administration number issued for prescribing a controlled  
| substance in this state of the prescribing practitioner, all  
| information required to be provided by a practitioner under Section  
| 481.075(e)(1), and all information required to be provided by a  
| dispensing pharmacist under Section 481.075(e)(2).  
|  _(b-2)_ _____In an emergency described by Subsection (b-1), an_  
| _agent designated in writing by a practitioner defined by Section_  
| _481.002(39)(A) may communicate a prescription by telephone._ ___A_  
| _practitioner who designates a different agent shall designate that_  
| _agent in writing and maintain the designation in the same manner in_  
| _which the practitioner initially designated an agent under this_  
| _subsection. On the request of a pharmacist, a practitioner shall_  
| _furnish a copy of the written designation. This subsection does not_  
| _relieve a practitioner or the practitioner's designated agent from_  
| _the requirement of Subchapter A, Chapter 562, Occupations Code. A_  
| _practitioner is personally responsible for the actions of the_  
| _designated agent in communicating a prescription to a pharmacist._  
|  (c) Not later than the seventh day after the date a  
| prescribing practitioner authorizes an emergency oral or  
| telephonically communicated prescription, the prescribing  
| practitioner shall cause _an_ [ ~~a written or~~ ] electronic prescription,  
| completed in the manner required by Section 481.075, to be  
| delivered to the dispensing pharmacist at the pharmacy where the  
| prescription was dispensed. [ ~~A written prescription may be~~  
|  ~~delivered in person or by mail. The envelope of a prescription~~  
|  ~~delivered by mail must be postmarked not later than the seventh day~~  
|  ~~after the date~~ ~~~~ ~~the prescription was authorized.~~ ~~~~ ~~On
receipt of a~~  
|  ~~written prescription, the dispensing pharmacy shall file the~~  
|  ~~transcription of the telephonically communicated prescription and~~  
|  ~~the pharmacy copy and shall send information to the board as~~  
|  ~~required by Section 481.075.~~ ]  On receipt of _the_ [ ~~an~~ ]
electronic  
| prescription, the pharmacist shall annotate the electronic  
| prescription record with the original authorization and date of the  
| emergency oral or telephonically communicated prescription.  
|  (e) The partial filling of a prescription for a controlled  
| substance listed in Schedule II is permissible _in accordance with_  
| _applicable federal law_ [ ~~, if the pharmacist is unable to supply the~~  
|  ~~full quantity called for in a written or electronic prescription or~~  
|  ~~emergency oral prescription and the pharmacist makes a notation of~~ ~~~~  
|  ~~the quantity supplied on the face of the written prescription, on~~  
|  ~~the written record of the emergency oral prescription, or in the~~  
|  ~~electronic prescription record.~~ ~~~~ ~~The remaining portion of the~~  
|  ~~prescription may be filled within 72 hours of the first partial~~  
|  ~~filling; however, if the remaining portion is not or cannot be~~  
|  ~~filled within the 72-hour period, the pharmacist shall so notify~~  
|  ~~the prescribing individual practitioner.~~ ~~~~ ~~No further quantity
may~~  
|  ~~be supplied beyond 72 hours without a new prescription~~ ].  
|  (f) A prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance  
| for a patient in a long-term care facility (LTCF) or for a patient  
| with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be  
| filled in partial quantities to include individual dosage units. If  
| there is any question about whether a patient may be classified as  
| having a terminal illness, the pharmacist must contact the  
| practitioner before partially filling the prescription.  Both the  
| pharmacist and the practitioner have a corresponding  
| responsibility to assure that the controlled substance is for a  
| terminally ill patient. The pharmacist must record the prescription  
| [ ~~on an official prescription form or~~ ] in the electronic  
| prescription record and must indicate [ ~~on the official prescription~~  
|  ~~form or~~ ] in the electronic prescription record whether the patient  
| is "terminally ill" or an "LTCF patient." A prescription that is  
| partially filled and does not contain the notation "terminally ill"  
| or "LTCF patient" is considered to have been filled in violation of  
| this chapter. For each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist  
| shall record [ ~~on the back of the official prescription form or~~ ] in  
| the electronic prescription record the date of the partial filling,  
| the quantity dispensed, the remaining quantity authorized to be  
| dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist.  
| Before any subsequent partial filling, the pharmacist must  
| determine that the additional partial filling is necessary. The  
| total quantity of Schedule II controlled substances dispensed in  
| all partial fillings may not exceed the total quantity prescribed.  
| Schedule II prescriptions for patients in a long-term care facility  
| or patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness  
| are valid for a period not to exceed 60 days following the issue  
| date unless sooner terminated by discontinuance of the medication.  
|  (g) A person may not dispense a controlled substance in  
| Schedule III or IV that is a prescription drug under the Federal  
| Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. Section 301 et seq.) without  
| a [ ~~written, electronic, oral, or telephonically communicated~~ ]  
| prescription of a practitioner defined by Section 481.002(39)(A) or  
| (D), except that the practitioner may dispense the substance  
| directly to an ultimate user. A prescription for a controlled  
| substance listed in Schedule III or IV may not be filled or refilled  
| later than six months after the date on which the prescription is  
| issued and may not be refilled more than five times, unless the  
| prescription is renewed by the practitioner. A prescription under  
| this subsection must comply with other applicable state and federal  
| laws.  
|  (h) A pharmacist may dispense a controlled substance listed  
| in Schedule III, IV, or V under a [ ~~written, electronic, oral, or~~  
|  ~~telephonically communicated~~ ] prescription issued by a practitioner  
| defined by Section 481.002(39)(C) [ ~~and~~ ] only if the pharmacist  
| determines that the prescription was issued for a valid medical  
| purpose and in the course of professional practice. A prescription  
| _described by_ [ ~~issued under~~ ] this subsection may not be filled or  
| refilled later than six months after the date the prescription is  
| issued and may not be refilled more than five times, unless the  
| prescription is renewed by the practitioner.  
|  (k) A prescription for a controlled substance must show:  
|  (1) the quantity of the substance prescribed:  
|  (A) [ ~~numerically, followed by the number written~~  
|  ~~as a word, if the prescription is written;~~  
|  [ ~~(B)~~ ] numerically, if the prescription is  
| electronic; or  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~(C)~~ ] if the prescription is communicated  
| orally or telephonically, as transcribed by the receiving  
| pharmacist;  
|  (2) the date of issue;  
|  (2-a) if the prescription is issued for a Schedule II  
| controlled substance to be filled at a later date under Subsection  
| (d-1), the earliest date on which a pharmacy may fill the  
| prescription;  
|  (3) the name, address, and date of birth or age of the  
| patient or, if the controlled substance is prescribed for an  
| animal, the species of the animal and the name and address of its  
| owner;  
|  (4) the name and strength of the controlled substance  
| prescribed;  
|  (5) the directions for use of the controlled  
| substance;  
|  (6) the intended use of the substance prescribed  
| unless the practitioner determines the furnishing of this  
| information is not in the best interest of the patient; _and_  
|  (7) the name, address, Federal Drug Enforcement  
| Administration number, and telephone number of the practitioner at  
| the practitioner's usual place of business[ ~~, which must be legibly~~  
|  ~~printed or stamped on a written prescription; and~~  
|  [ ~~(8)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~if the prescription is handwritten, the signature~~  
|  ~~of the prescribing practitioner~~ ].  
|  (q) Each dispensing pharmacist shall send all required  
| information[ ~~, including any information required to complete the~~  
|  ~~Schedule III through V prescription forms,~~ ] to the board by  
| electronic transfer or another form approved by the board not later  
| than the next business day after the date the prescription is  
| completely filled.

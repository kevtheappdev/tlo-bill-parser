| further investigation. If the department determines that the  
| abuse or neglect involves an employee of a public _or private_

| the school, the department shall orally notify the superintendent  
| of the school district _, the director of the open-enrollment charter_

|  (1) the person alleged to have committed abuse or  
| neglect poses a substantial and immediate risk of harm to one or  
| more children outside the family of a child who is the subject of  
| the investigation; and  
|  (2) the release of the information is necessary to  
| assist in protecting one or more children from the person alleged to  
| have committed abuse or neglect.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 261.406(a) and (b), Family Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) On receipt of a report of alleged or suspected abuse or

|  ~~jurisdiction of the Texas Education Agency~~ ], the department shall  
| perform an investigation as provided by this chapter.  
|  (b) The department shall send a copy of the completed report  
| of the department's investigation to the Texas Education Agency _or,_  
| _in the case of a private school, the school's chief executive_  
| _officer_.  On request, the department shall provide a copy of the  
| completed report of the department's investigation to the State  
| Board for Educator Certification, the local school board or the

| is the subject of the investigation and to the person alleged to  
| have committed the abuse or neglect.  The report of investigation  
| shall be edited to protect the identity of the persons who made the  
| report of abuse or neglect.  _Except as otherwise provided by this_  
| _subsection_ [ ~~Other than the persons authorized by the section to~~  
|  ~~receive a copy of the report~~ ], Section 261.201(b) applies to the  
| release of the report relating to the investigation of abuse or

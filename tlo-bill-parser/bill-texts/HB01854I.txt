|  SECTION 1. Section 155.004(a), Family Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) A court of this state loses its continuing, exclusive  
| jurisdiction to modify its order if:

|  (2) the parents of the child have remarried each other  
| after the dissolution of a previous marriage between them and file a  
| suit for the dissolution of their subsequent marriage combined with  
| a suit affecting the parent-child relationship as if there had not  
| been a prior court with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the  
| child; or  
|  (3) another court assumed jurisdiction over a suit and  
| rendered a final order based on incorrect information received from  
| the vital statistics unit that there was no court of continuing,  
| exclusive jurisdiction.

| only to an order of adoption rendered on or after the effective date

| order of adoption rendered in an original suit filed as described by  
| Section 103.001(b), Family Code, on or after September 1, 2015, but  
| before the effective date of this Act by a court that would have  
| exclusive jurisdiction to render the order as a result of a court of  
| this state losing its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under  
| Section 155.004(a), Family Code, as amended by this Act, is a final  
| order and is not subject to an appeal on that basis.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

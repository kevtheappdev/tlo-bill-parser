| relating to the prosecution of the criminal offense of theft of  
| service.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 31.04, Penal Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a) and (b) and adding Subsection (b-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) A person commits theft of service if, with intent to  
| avoid payment for service that the actor knows is provided only for  
| compensation:  
|  (1) the actor intentionally or knowingly secures  
| performance of the service by deception, threat, or false token;  
|  (2) having control over the disposition of services of  
| another to which the actor is not entitled, the actor intentionally  
| or knowingly diverts the other's services to the actor's own benefit  
| or to the benefit of another not entitled to the services;  
|  (3) having control of personal property under a  
| written rental agreement _containing the notice and the actor's_  
| _acknowledgement of that notice as required by Subsection (b-1)_ , the  
| actor holds the property beyond the expiration of the rental period  
| without the effective consent of the owner of the property, thereby  
| depriving the owner of the property of its use in further rentals;  
| or  
|  (4) the actor intentionally or knowingly secures the  
| performance of the service by agreeing to provide compensation and,  
| after the service is rendered, fails to make full payment after  
| receiving notice demanding payment.  
|  (b) For purposes of this section, _the following are prima_  
| _facie evidence of the actor's_ intent to avoid payment [ ~~is presumed~~  
|  ~~if~~ ]:  
|  (1) the actor absconded without paying for the service  
| or expressly refused to pay for the service in circumstances where  
| payment is ordinarily made immediately upon rendering of the  
| service, as in hotels, campgrounds, recreational vehicle parks,  
| restaurants, and comparable establishments;  
|  (2) the actor failed to make payment under a service  
| agreement within 10 days after receiving notice demanding payment;  
|  (3) the actor returns property held under a rental  
| agreement after the expiration of the rental agreement and fails to  
| pay the applicable rental charge for the property within 10 days  
| after the date on which the actor received notice demanding  
| payment; or  
|  (4) the actor failed to return the property held under  
| a rental agreement:  
|  (A) within five days after receiving notice  
| demanding return, if the property is valued at less than $2,500; or  
|  (B) within three days after receiving notice  
| demanding return, if the property is valued at $2,500 or more.  
|  _(b-1) For purposes of Subsection (a)(3):_  
|  _(1)_ _____the written rental agreement or an addendum to the_  
| _agreement must contain a notice in substantially the following_  
| _form:_  
| _"NOTICE_  
| _Failure to return rental property on or before the date the rental_  
| _period expires and failure to pay all amounts due, including costs_  
| _for damage to the rental property, is prima facie evidence of an_  
| _intent to avoid payment under Section 31.04 of the Texas Penal Code_  
| _(Theft of Service)."; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the notice described by Subdivision (1) must_  
| _contain the signature or mark of the actor acknowledging the_  
| _notice._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred  
| before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| or contract that meets the requirements of this section.  
|  (c) Should the license _or registration_ holder for financial  
| reasons or for lack of availability of an underwriter willing to

| Subsection (a) or should the policy limits be exhausted, the  
| [ ~~license~~ ] holder shall _timely_ notify the parent or _guardian of_ [

| [ ~~license~~ ] holder shall also notify the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ]

| application for renewal of a license to determine if all licensing  
| requirements are met _and whether the facility has been cited for_  
| _repeated violations or has established a pattern of violations_  
| _during the preceding two years_. The evaluation may include a  
| specified number of visits to the facility and must include a review  
| of all required forms and records. _If the commission determines the_

|  (d) A family home that provides care for four or more  
| children, excluding children who are related to the caretaker,

| _forms and records. If the commission determines the facility or_  
| _family home has repeated violations or an established pattern of_  
| _violations, before the commission renews the certification or_  
| _registration_ ___the commission may place restrictions, conditions, or_  
| _additional requirements on the certification or registration to_  
| _ensure the violations cease._  
|  _(f-3)_ _____The commission may not renew the certification or_  
| _registration of a facility or family home cited for a violation that_  
| _is not corrected by the required compliance date unless the_  
| _violation is pending an administrative review under commission_  
| _rules or pending review as a contested case under Chapter 2001,_  
| _Government Code._  
|  (i) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall provide to a listed  
| family home a copy of the listing. A listing must contain a  
| provision that states:  "THIS HOME IS A LISTED FAMILY HOME.  IT IS

| a subsequent background and criminal history check, the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] shall automatically:  
|  (1) suspend the home's listing until the required

| information is not submitted within six months after the date the  
| automatic suspension begins.  
|  (k) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall issue a listing or  
| registration to a family home, as appropriate, in both English and

| precinct in a county in which the family home is located is of  
| Hispanic origin or Spanish-speaking.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 42.063, Human Resources Code, is amended  
| by amending Subsections (b), (d), and (g) and adding Subsections  
| (b-1) and (b-2) to read as follows:  
|  (b) A person licensed under this chapter shall report to the

| _website._  
|  (d) An employee or volunteer of a general residential  
| operation, child-placing agency, continuum-of-care residential  
| operation, cottage home operation, or specialized child-care home  
| shall report any serious incident directly to the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] if the incident involves a child under the care of the  
| operation, agency, or home.  
|  (g) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall implement this  
| section using existing appropriations.  
|  SECTION 8. Sections 42.072(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g),  
| Human Resources Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may suspend, deny, revoke,  
| or refuse to renew the license, listing, registration, or  
| certification of approval of a facility or family home that does not  
| comply with the requirements of this chapter, _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] standards and rules, or the specific terms of the  
| license, listing, registration, or certification. The _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] may revoke the probation of a person whose license,  
| listing, or registration is suspended if the person violates a term  
| of the conditions of probation.  
|  (b) If the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] proposes to take an  
| action under Subsection (a), the person is entitled to a hearing  
| conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  
| Proceedings for a disciplinary action are governed by the  
| administrative procedure law, Chapter 2001, Government Code. An  
| action under this section, including a revocation of a person's  
| license, is a contested case as defined by Chapter 2001, Government  
| Code, and is subject to judicial review under the substantial  
| evidence rule in accordance with that chapter. Rules of practice  
| adopted by the executive commissioner under Section 2001.004,  
| Government Code, applicable to the proceedings for a disciplinary  
| action may not conflict with rules adopted by the State Office of  
| Administrative Hearings.  
|  (c) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may not issue _or renew_ a  
| license, listing, registration, or certification to a person whose  
| license, listing, registration, or certification is revoked _or not_  
| _renewed_ or whose application for a license, listing, registration,  
| or certification is denied for a substantive reason under this  
| chapter before the fifth anniversary of the date on which the  
| revocation takes effect by _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] or court order  
| or the decision to deny the application is final.  
|  (e) A person may continue to operate a facility or family  
| home during an appeal of a [ ~~license, listing, or registration~~ ]  
| revocation _or refusal to renew a license, certification, or_  
| _registration_ unless the operation of the facility or family home  
| poses a risk to the health or safety of children.  The executive  
| commissioner shall by rule establish the criteria for determining  
| whether the operation of a facility or family home poses a risk to  
| the health or safety of children.  The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ]  
| shall notify the facility or family home of the criteria the  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] used to determine that the operation of the  
| facility or family home poses a risk to health or safety and that  
| the facility or family home may not operate.  A person who has been  
| notified by the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] that the facility or home  
| may not operate under this section may seek injunctive relief from a  
| district court in Travis County or in the county in which the  
| facility or home is located to allow operation during the pendency  
| of an appeal.  The court may grant injunctive relief against the  
| _commission's_ [ ~~department's~~ ] action only if the court finds that the  
| child-care operation does not pose a health or safety risk to  
| children.  A court granting injunctive relief under this subsection  
| shall have no other jurisdiction over an appeal of final _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] action unless conferred by Chapter 2001, Government  
| Code.  
|  (f) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall deny an application  
| or renewal for listing or registering a family home or shall revoke  
| a family home's listing or registration if the results of a  
| background or criminal history check conducted by the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] under Section 42.056 show that a person has been  
| convicted of an offense under Title 5 or 6, Penal Code, or Chapter  
| 43, Penal Code.  
|  (g) Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] may refuse to issue a license, listing, registration,  
| or certification to:  
|  (1) a person whose license, listing, registration, or  
| certification for a facility or family home was revoked by the  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] or by court order;  
|  (2) a person who was a controlling person of a facility  
| or family home at the time conduct occurred that resulted in the  
| revocation of the license, listing, registration, or certification  
| of the facility or family home;  
|  (3) a person who voluntarily closed a facility or  
| family home or relinquished the person's license, listing,  
| registration, or certification after:  
|  (A) the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] took an action  
| under Subsection (a) in relation to the facility, family home, or  
| person; or  
|  (B) the person received notice that the  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] intended to take an action under Subsection  
| (a) in relation to the facility, family home, or person; or  
|  (4) a person who was a controlling person of a facility  
| or family home at the time conduct occurred that resulted in the  
| closure of the facility or family home or relinquishment of the  
| license, listing, registration, or certification in the manner  
| described by Subdivision (3).  
|  SECTION 9. Section 42.078, Human Resources Code, is amended  
| by amending Subsections (a), (a-2), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (m),  
| (n), and (r) and adding Subsections (e-1) and (e-2) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may impose an  
| administrative sanction or an administrative penalty against a  
| facility or family home licensed, registered, or listed under this

| this chapter.  In addition, the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may impose  
| an administrative penalty against a facility or family home or a  
| controlling person of a facility or family home if the facility,  
| family home, or controlling person:  
|  (1) violates a term of a license or registration  
| issued under this chapter;  
|  (2) makes a statement about a material fact that the  
| facility or person knows or should know is false:

| section.  
|  (a-2) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may impose an  
| administrative penalty without first imposing a nonmonetary  
| administrative sanction for violating a minimum standard  
| applicable to a facility or family home under this chapter that is

| standard, including _standards for a violation constituting abuse,_  
| _neglect, or exploitation of a child,_ background check standards,  
| safety hazard standards, _standards establishing times for_  
| _reporting information to a parent or guardian or the commission,_  
| and supervision standards.  
|  (e) If the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] determines that a  
| violation has occurred, the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ]  may issue a  
| recommendation on the imposition of a penalty, including a  
| recommendation on the amount of the penalty.  
|  _(e-1)_ _____Notwithstanding the amounts required by Subsections_  
| _(b) and (c), the commission shall recommend the penalty for the_  
| _following violations by a facility or family home to be assessed in_  
| _the following amounts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____$1,000 for a violation that constitutes abuse,_  
| _neglect, or exploitation of a child;_

| _that requires treatment by a medical professional or_  
| _hospitalization or an illness of a child that requires_  
| _hospitalization;_  
|  _(3)_ _____$50 for failure to report to a parent or guardian_

| _required by commission standards that the commission cited the_  
| _facility or home for a violation:_  
|  _(A)_ _____that constitutes abuse, neglect, or_  
| _exploitation of a child; or_  
|  _(B) of a safe sleeping standard; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____$50 for failure to report to a parent or guardian_  
| _of each child in the care of the facility or home within the time_

| _violation continues or occurs._  
|  (f) Within 14 days after the date the recommendation is  
| issued, the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall give written notice of  
| the recommendation to the person owning or operating the facility  
| or family home or to the controlling person, if applicable. The  
| notice may be given by certified mail. The notice must include a  
| brief summary of the alleged violation and a statement of the amount  
| of the recommended penalty and must inform the person that the  
| person has a right to a hearing on the occurrence of the violation,  
| the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation  
| and the amount of the penalty.  
|  (g) Within 20 days after the date the person receives the

| recommended penalty of the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] or may make a  
| written request for a hearing on the occurrence of the violation,  
| the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation  
| and the amount of the penalty.  
|  (h) If the person accepts the determination and recommended  
| penalty of the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] or fails to respond to the  
| notice in a timely manner, the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall issue  
| an order and impose the recommended penalty.  
|  (i) If the person requests a hearing, the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] shall set a hearing and give notice of the hearing to  
| the person.  The hearing shall be held by an administrative law  
| judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  The  
| administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and  
| conclusions of law and issue a final decision finding that a  
| violation has occurred and imposing a penalty or finding that no  
| violation occurred.  
|  (m) On receipt of a copy of an affidavit under Subsection  
| (l)(2), the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may file with the court, within  
| five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the  
| affidavit. The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in  
| the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement  
| of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true. The  
| person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the  
| person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to  
| give a supersedeas bond.  
|  (n) If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and  
| the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] may refer the matter to the attorney general for  
| collection of the amount of the penalty.  
|  (r) A penalty collected under this section shall be sent to  
| the comptroller for deposit in the _safety training account_  
| _established under Section 42.04215_ [ ~~general revenue fund~~ ].  
|  SECTION 10. As soon as practicable after the effective date  
| of this Act, the executive commissioner of the Health and Human  
| Services Commission shall adopt the rules necessary to implement  
| the changes in law made by this Act.  
|  SECTION 11. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a study by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating  
| Board concerning the long-term effects of regulating tuition rates  
| and amounts charged by public institutions of higher education.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter C, Chapter 61, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 61.06695 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___61.06695._ _____STUDY CONCERNING REGULATION OF TUITION. (a)_  
| _The board shall conduct a study to examine the long-term costs,_  
| _benefits, and other effects of any legislative action that may be_  
| _taken to regulate the rates and amounts of tuition charged by_  
| _institutions of higher education, including by repealing the_  
| _statutory authority of those institutions to establish tuition_  
| _rates as they determine appropriate. The study may explore all_  
| _topics relevant to the matter but, in assessing the effects of_  
| _regulation, must strive to strike a balance between promoting the_  
| _affordability and accessibility of higher education in this state_  
| _and the institutions' need for sufficient revenue to maintain_  
| _educational quality for students and competitiveness with other_  
| _institutions outside this state. In the study, the board shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____recommend to the legislature an appropriate rate_  
| _or rates of tuition for institutions of higher education compared_  
| _to the rates currently established by the institutions;_  
|  _(2)_ _____evaluate the potential effects of regulating_  
| _tuition rates and amounts on student access to higher education_  
| _opportunities in this state, including the effect on enrollment by_  
| _disadvantaged or underrepresented Texans, and the potential_  
| _effects on affordability, student financial aid, and student loan_  
| _debt;_  
|  _(3)_ _____estimate the potential loss or gain of funding or_  
| _revenue by the institutions as a result of any repeal of the_  
| _existing statutory authority of those institutions to establish_  
| _tuition rates; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____if the board projects that regulating tuition_  
| _rates and amounts would result in a loss of revenue under_  
| _Subdivision (3):_  
|  _(A)_ _____identify any sources of funding or revenue,_  
| _such as institutional endowments, that would be available or_  
| _necessary to offset the projected decrease in revenue; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____recommend a specific portion or amount of_  
| _endowment money that could be used to offset the reduced tuition_  
| _revenues._  
|  _(b)_ _____Not later than December 1, 2020, the board shall submit_  
| _to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house_  
| _of representatives, and the presiding officer of each standing_  
| _legislative committee having jurisdiction over higher education or_  
| _state appropriations a report on the results of the study and the_  
| _board's recommendations for legislative or other action._  
|  _(c) This section expires September 1, 2021._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

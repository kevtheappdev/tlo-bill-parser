|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the school district property value study conducted by  
| the comptroller of public accounts.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 403.3011(2), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (2) "Eligible school district" means a school district  
| for which the comptroller has determined the following:  
|  (A) in the most recent study, the local value is  
| invalid under Section 403.302(c) and does not exceed the state  
| value for the school district determined in the study;  
|  (B) in the two studies preceding the most recent  
| study, the school district's local value was valid under Section  
| 403.302(c);  
|  (C) in the most recent study, the aggregate local  
| value of all of the categories of property sampled by the  
| comptroller is not less than _80_ [ ~~90~~ ] percent of the lower limit of  
| the margin of error as determined by the comptroller of the  
| aggregate value as determined by the comptroller of all of the  
| categories of property sampled by the comptroller; and  
|  (D) the appraisal district that appraises  
| property for the school district was in compliance with the scoring  
| requirement of the comptroller's most recent review of the  
| appraisal district conducted under Section 5.102, Tax Code.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 403.302(c), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) If after conducting the study the comptroller  
| determines that the local value for a school district is valid, the  
| local value is presumed to represent taxable value for the school  
| district. In the absence of that presumption, taxable value for a  
| school district is the state value for the school district  
| determined by the comptroller under Subsections (a) and (b) unless  
| the local value exceeds the state value, in which case the taxable  
| value for the school district is the district's local value. In  
| determining whether the local value for a school district is valid,  
| the comptroller shall use a margin of error that does not exceed _10_  
| [ ~~five~~ ] percent unless the comptroller determines that the size of  
| the sample of properties necessary to make the determination makes  
| the use of such a margin of error not feasible, in which case the  
| comptroller may use a larger margin of error.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the annual study conducted under Section 403.302, Government  
| Code, for a tax year that begins on or after January 1, 2020.  The  
| annual study for a tax year that begins before that date is covered  
| by the law in effect immediately before the effective date of this  
| Act, and the prior law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect on the 91st day after the last day of the  
| legislative session.

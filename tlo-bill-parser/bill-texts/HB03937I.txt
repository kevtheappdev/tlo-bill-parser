|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a report regarding Medicaid reimbursement rates and  
| access to care.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) In this section, "commission" means the  
| Health and Human Services Commission.  
|  (b) The commission shall prepare a written report regarding  
| provider reimbursement rates and access to care in the Medicaid  
| program.  The report must:  
|  (1) outline each factor of the reimbursement rate  
| methodology used by Medicaid managed care organizations and that  
| factor's weight in the methodology;  
|  (2) explicitly illustrate the manner in which the  
| following affect current methodologies:  
|  (A) previously adopted reimbursement rates;  
|  (B) the cost of uncompensated care provided to  
| uninsured persons; and  
|  (C) use of private insurance benefits;  
|  (3) propose alternative reimbursement methodologies  
| that do not consider the items described by Subdivision (2) of this  
| subsection;  
|  (4) evaluate how Medicaid provider reimbursement  
| rates affect access to care for Medicaid recipients, measured by  
| the number of providers each year who have stopped participating in  
| Medicaid since the commission began offering Medicaid services  
| through a managed care delivery model;  
|  (5) compare provider participation in Medicaid by  
| region, particularly increases or decreases in the number of  
| participating providers since the commission began offering  
| Medicaid services through a managed care delivery model,  
| categorized by provider specialty and subspecialty;  
|  (6) list, for each year since the commission began  
| offering Medicaid services through a managed care delivery model,  
| counties in which provider access standards have not been met;  
|  (7) examine Medicaid provider incentive payment  
| programs and their effect on incentivizing providers to participate  
| or continue participating in Medicaid; and  
|  (8) determine the feasibility and cost of  
| establishing:  
|  (A) a minimum fee schedule for Medicaid providers  
| in counties where provider access standards are not being met; and  
|  (B) a different reimbursement rate for classes of  
| providers who provide care in a county:  
|  (i) located on an international border; or  
|  (ii) with a Medicaid population at least 10  
| percent higher than the statewide average Medicaid population.  
|  (c) Not later than December 1, 2020, the commission shall  
| prepare and submit to the legislature the report described by  
| Subsection (b) of this section.  Notwithstanding that subsection,  
| the commission is not required to include in the report any  
| information the commission determines is proprietary.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

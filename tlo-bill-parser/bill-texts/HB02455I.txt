|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the limitation of certain special district tax on the  
| homesteads of the disabled and elderly.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.261, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 11.261. LIMITATION OF [ ~~COUNTY, MUNICIPAL, OR JUNIOR~~  
|  ~~COLLEGE~~ ] DISTRICT TAX ON HOMESTEADS OF DISABLED AND ELDERLY.  (a)  
| _"District" is defined as a county, municipality, junior college,_  
| _regional water district or hospital district._ This section applies  
| only to a [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district that  
| has established a limitation on the total amount of taxes that may  
| be imposed by the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ]  
| district on the residence homestead of a disabled individual or an  
| individual 65 years of age or older under Section _1-b_ (h), Article  
| VIII, Texas Constitution.  
|  (b) The tax officials shall appraise the property to which  
| the limitation applies and calculate taxes as on other property,  
| but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation provided by this  
| section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this  
| section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  The  
| [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district may not increase  
| the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes the [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district imposes on the residence  
| homestead of a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age  
| or older above the amount of the taxes the [ ~~county, municipality, or~~  
|  ~~junior college~~ ]district imposed on the residence homestead in the  
| first tax year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in  
| which the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district  
| established the limitation described by Subsection (a), in which  
| the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption  
| provided by Section _11.13_ (c) for a disabled individual or an  
| individual 65 years of age or older.  If the individual qualified  
| that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of  
| that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for  
| the exemption for the next year, and if the [ ~~]~~ district taxes  
| imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less than  
| the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district may not subsequently  
| increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes it imposes on  
| the residence homestead above the amount it imposed on the  
| residence homestead in the year immediately following the first  
| year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in which the  
| [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district established the  
| limitation described by Subsection (a), for which the individual  
| qualified that residence homestead for the exemption.  
|  (c) If an individual makes improvements to the individual's  
| residence homestead, other than repairs and other than improvements  
| required to comply with governmental requirements, the [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district may increase the amount  
| of taxes on the homestead in the first year the value of the  
| homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the  
| enhancement of value by the improvements. The amount of the tax  
| increase is determined by applying the current tax rate to the  
| difference between the appraised value of the homestead with the  
| improvements and the appraised value it would have had without the  
| improvements.  A limitation provided by this section then applies  
| to the increased amount of [ ~~county, municipal, or junior college~~ ]  
| district taxes on the residence homestead until more improvements,  
| if any, are made.  
|  (d) A limitation on [ ~~county, municipal, or junior college~~ ]  
| district tax increases provided by this section expires if on  
| January 1:  
|  (1) none of the owners of the structure who qualify for  
| the exemption provided by Section _11.13_ (c) for a disabled  
| individual or an individual 65 years of age or older and who owned  
| the structure when the limitation provided by this section first  
| took effect is using the structure as a residence homestead; or  
|  (2) none of the owners of the structure qualifies for  
| the exemption provided by Section _11.13_ (c) for a disabled  
| individual or an individual 65 years of age or older.  
|  (e) If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised  
| value for a prior year because a residence homestead exemption for  
| disabled individuals or individuals 65 years of age or older was  
| erroneously allowed, the tax assessor for the applicable [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district shall add, as back taxes  
| due as provided by Section _26.09_ (d), the positive difference, if  
| any, between the tax that should have been imposed for that year and  
| the tax that was imposed because of the provisions of this section.  
|  (f) A limitation on tax increases provided by this section  
| does not expire because the owner of an interest in the structure  
| conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined by Section  
| _11.13_ (j) if the owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the  
| trust and is entitled to occupy the structure.  
|  (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), if an individual  
| who receives a limitation on [ ~~county, municipal, or junior college~~ ]  
| district tax increases provided by this section subsequently  
| qualifies a different residence homestead in the same [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district for an exemption under  
| Section _11.13_ , the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ]  
| district may not impose ad valorem taxes on the subsequently  
| qualified homestead in a year in an amount that exceeds the amount  
| of taxes the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district  
| would have imposed on the subsequently qualified homestead in the  
| first year in which the individual receives that exemption for the  
| subsequently qualified homestead had the limitation on tax  
| increases provided by this section not been in effect, multiplied  
| by a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount of taxes  
| the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district imposed on  
| the former homestead in the last year in which the individual  
| received that exemption for the former homestead and the  
| denominator of which is the total amount of taxes the [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district would have imposed on the  
| former homestead in the last year in which the individual received  
| that exemption for the former homestead had the limitation on tax  
| increases provided by this section not been in effect.  
|  (h) An individual who receives a limitation on [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipal, or junior college~~ ] district tax increases under this  
| section and who subsequently qualifies a different residence  
| homestead in the same [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ]  
| district for an exemption under Section _11.13_ , or an agent of the  
| individual, is entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the  
| appraisal district in which the former homestead was located a  
| written certificate providing the information necessary to  
| determine whether the individual may qualify for a limitation on  
| the subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to  
| calculate the amount of taxes the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior~~  
|  ~~college~~ ] district may impose on the subsequently qualified  
| homestead.  
|  (i) If an individual who qualifies for a limitation on  
| [ ~~county, municipal, or junior college~~ ] district tax increases under  
| this section dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is  
| entitled to the limitation on taxes imposed by the [ ~~county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college~~ ] district on the residence  
| homestead of the individual if:  
|  (1) the surviving spouse is disabled or is 55 years of  
| age or older when the individual dies; and  
|  (2) the residence homestead of the individual:  
|  (A) is the residence homestead of the surviving  
| spouse on the date that the individual dies; and  
|  (B) remains the residence homestead of the  
| surviving spouse.  
|  (j) If an individual who is 65 years of age or older and  
| qualifies for a limitation on [ ~~county, municipal, or junior~~  
|  ~~college~~ ] district tax increases for the elderly under this section  
| dies in the first year in which the individual qualified for the  
| limitation and the individual first qualified for the limitation  
| after the beginning of that year, except as provided by Subsection  
| (k), the amount to which the surviving spouse's [ ~~county, municipal,~~  
|  ~~or junior college~~ ] district taxes are limited under Subsection (i)  
| is the amount of taxes imposed by the [ ~~county, municipality, or~~  
|  ~~junior college~~ ] district, as applicable, on the residence homestead  
| in that year determined as if the individual qualifying for the  
| exemption had lived for the entire year.  
|  (k) If in the first tax year after the year in which an  
| individual who is 65 years of age or older dies under the  
| circumstances described by Subsection (j) the amount of taxes  
| imposed by a [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district on  
| the residence homestead of the surviving spouse is less than the  
| amount of taxes imposed by the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior~~  
|  ~~college~~ ] district in the preceding year as limited by Subsection  
| (j), in a subsequent tax year the surviving spouse's taxes imposed  
| by the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district on that  
| residence homestead are limited to the amount of taxes imposed by  
| the [ ~~county, municipality, or junior college~~ ] district in that  
| first tax year after the year in which the individual dies.  
|  (l) Notwithstanding Subsection (d), a limitation on  
| [ ~~county, municipal, or junior college~~ ] district tax increases  
| provided by this section does not expire if the owner of the  
| structure qualifies for an exemption under Section _11.13_ under the  
| circumstances described by Section _11.135_ (a).  
|  (m) Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c), an improvement  
| to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under  
| Subsection (c) is not treated as an improvement under that  
| subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a  
| structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty  
| or by wind or water damage.  For purposes of appraising the property  
| in the tax year in which the structure would have constituted an  
| improvement under Subsection (c), the replacement structure is  
| considered to be an improvement under that subsection only if:  
|  (1) the square footage of the replacement structure  
| exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed  
| before the casualty or damage occurred; or  
|  (2) the exterior of the replacement structure is of  
| higher quality construction and composition than that of the  
| replaced structure.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

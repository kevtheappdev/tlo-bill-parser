|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to permit application requirements for taking sand,  
| gravel, marl, shell, and mudshell.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 86.003, Parks and Wildlife Code, is  
| amended by adding Subsection (c) to read as follows:  
|  _(c)_ _____The commission shall prescribe a single application_  
| _form for an individual or general permit. The form must require_  
| _individual and general permit applicants to provide the same_  
| _information, including information regarding:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the publication of notice in a daily or weekly_  
| _newspaper other than the newspaper with the greatest circulation in_  
| _the county or counties affected by the issuance of the permit;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the mailing addresses of alongshore property_  
| _owners for one-half of a river mile above and below the proposed_  
| _area of disturbance described in the permit;_  
|  _(3) a sedimentation impact assessment;_  
|  _(4)_ _____any amendments to the permit, if the application_  
| _is for the renewal of a permit;_  
|  _(5)_ _____the tax delinquency status of the applicant, if_

| after the effective date of this Act. A permit application for the  
| taking of sand, gravel, marl, shell, or mudshell filed before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the  
| permit application was filed, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.

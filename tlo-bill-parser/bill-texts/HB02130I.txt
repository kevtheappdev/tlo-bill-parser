|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the duties of the court regarding a plea bargain  
| agreement that requires a defendant to pay costs associated with  
| court-appointed counsel.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 26.13, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Subsection (h-2) to read as follows:  
|  _(h-2)(1)_ _____Before accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo_  
| _contendere in a case in which a plea bargain agreement exists, the_  
| _court shall inquire as to whether the agreement requires the_  
| _defendant to pay in part or in whole the costs of legal services_  
| _provided to the defendant in accordance with Article 1.051(c) or_  
| _(d), including any expenses and costs._  
|  _(2)_ _____If the plea bargain agreement requires payment of_  
| _the costs of legal services as described by Subdivision (1), the_  
| _court shall determine, in accordance with Articles 26.05(g) and_  
| _42A.301(b)(11), the amount the defendant is able to pay for the_  
| _legal services._  
|  _(3)_ _____The failure of the court to comply with_  
| _Subdivision (1) or (2) is not a ground for the defendant to set_  
| _aside the conviction, sentence, or plea, except that after_  
| _imposition of the sentence or placement on community supervision,_  
| _including deferred adjudication community supervision, any order_  
| _requiring the defendant to pay an amount for legal services becomes_  
| _void if the court does not substantially comply with those_  
| _subdivisions._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a plea of guilty or nolo contendere entered on or after the  
| effective date of this Act, regardless of whether the offense with  
| reference to which the plea is entered is committed before, on, or  
| after that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

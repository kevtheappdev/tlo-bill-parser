|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the appraisal for ad valorem tax purposes of tangible  
| personal property held for sale at retail and a franchise tax credit  
| based on the ad valorem taxes paid on such property.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 23.12(a) and (f), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) Except as provided by Sections 23.121, [ ~~23.1241,~~ ]  
| 23.124, _23.1241, 23.1244,_ and 23.127, the market value of an  
| inventory is the price for which it would sell as a unit to a  
| purchaser who would continue the business. An inventory shall  
| include residential real property which has never been occupied as  
| a residence and is held for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or  
| business, provided that the residential real property remains  
| unoccupied, is not leased or rented, and produces no income.  
|  (f) The owner of an inventory other than a dealer's motor  
| vehicle inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.121, [ ~~a~~  
|  ~~dealer's heavy equipment inventory as that term is defined by~~  
|  ~~Section 23.1241, or~~ ] a dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory  
| as that term is defined by Section 23.124, _a dealer's heavy_  
| _equipment inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.1241, a_  
| _retail inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.1244,_ or a  
| retail manufactured housing inventory as that term is defined by  
| Section 23.127 may elect to have the inventory appraised at its  
| market value as of September 1 of the year preceding the tax year to  
| which the appraisal applies by filing an application with the chief  
| appraiser requesting that the inventory be appraised as of  
| September 1. The application must clearly describe the inventory  
| to which it applies and be signed by the owner of the inventory. The  
| application applies to the appraisal of the inventory in each tax  
| year that begins after the next August 1 following the date the  
| application is filed with the chief appraiser unless the owner of  
| the inventory by written notice filed with the chief appraiser  
| revokes the application or the ownership of the inventory changes.  
| A notice revoking the application is effective for each tax year  
| that begins after the next September following the date the notice  
| of revocation is filed with the chief appraiser.  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter B, Chapter 23, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 23.1244 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___23.1244._ _____RETAILER'S RETAIL INVENTORY; VALUE. (a) In_  
| _this section:_

| _section, the term does not include:_  
|  _(A) real property; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____inventory that qualifies for appraisal under_

|  _(4)_ _____"Retailer" means a person who is engaged in the_  
| _business in this state of selling retail inventory. For purposes of_

| _company._

| _12-month period._  
|  _(b)_ _____For the purpose of the computation of property tax, the_  
| _chief appraiser shall determine the market value of a retailer's_  
| _retail inventory on January 1 to be the average of the following_  
| _amounts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the market value of the retail inventory on that_  
| _date as determined under Section 23.12; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the retailer's total annual sales, less sales at_  
| _wholesale and sales to other retailers, for the 12-month period_

|  _(c)_ _____For the purpose of the computation of property tax on_  
| _the market value of the retail inventory of an owner who was not a_

| _inventory on January 1._  
|  _(f)_ _____The comptroller by rule shall adopt a retailer's retail_  
| _inventory declaration form. Not later than April 15 of each year,_  
| _or, in the case of a retailer who was not in business on January 1,_  
| _not later than 30 days after commencement of business, each_  
| _retailer shall file a declaration with the chief appraiser for each_  
| _location at which the retailer's retail inventory to be appraised_  
| _as provided by this section is located. The declaration is in_  
| _addition to the rendition statement or property report filed by the_  
| _retailer when rendering the retailer's retail inventory under_  
| _Chapter 22. The declaration is sufficient to comply with this_  
| _subsection if it sets forth:_

| _examine the books and records of a retailer. A request made under_  
| _this subsection must be made in writing, be delivered personally to_  
| _the custodian of the records at a location at which the retailer_  
| _conducts business, provide a period of not less than 15 days for the_  
| _person to respond to the request, and state that the person to whom_

| _the chief appraiser may examine:_  
|  _(1)_ _____documentation appropriate to allow the chief_  
| _appraiser to ascertain the applicability of this section to the_  
| _person; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____sales records to substantiate information set_  
| _forth in the declaration filed by the retailer._  
|  _(h)_ _____A retailer who fails to timely file a declaration under_  
| _Subsection (f) in a tax year waives any right to have the retailer's_  
| _retail inventory appraised as provided by this section in that tax_  
| _year, and the chief appraiser shall appraise the retailer's retail_  
| _inventory as provided by Section 23.12._  
|  _(i)_ _____Section 23.123 applies to a declaration filed under this_  
| _section in the same manner in which that section applies to a_

|  SECTION 3. Chapter 171, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subchapter N to read as follows:  
| _SUBCHAPTER N. TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AD VALOREM TAX PAYMENTS ON_  
| _INVENTORY_  
|  _Sec. 171.701. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1) "Qualified entity" means a taxable entity that:_  
|  _(A) is a retailer; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____pays ad valorem taxes on retail inventory_  
| _owned by the entity and located in this state._

|  _Sec._ ___171.702._ _____ELIGIBILITY FOR CREDIT. A qualified entity_  
| _is eligible to apply for a credit in the amount and under the_  
| _conditions and limitations provided by this subchapter against the_  
| _tax imposed under this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.703._ _____AMOUNT OF CREDIT; LIMITATIONS. (a) Subject_  
| _to Subsection (b), the total amount of the credit under this_  
| _subchapter is equal to the difference between the following_  
| _amounts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the amount of the ad valorem taxes paid by the_  
| _qualified entity during the period on which a report is based that_  
| _are derived from the taxable value of the entity's retail_  
| _inventory; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the amount of the ad valorem taxes the entity would_  
| _have paid during the period described by Subdivision (1) on the_  
| _taxable value of the entity's retail inventory if the taxable value_  
| _of that inventory were the amount determined under Section_  
| _23.1244(b)(2)._  
|  _(b)_ _____A qualified entity is not eligible for a credit under_

|  _Sec._ ___171.704._ _____CARRYFORWARD. (a) If a qualified entity is_  
| _eligible for a credit that exceeds the limitation under Section_  
| _171.703(c), the entity may carry the unused credit forward for not_  
| _more than three consecutive reports._  
|  _(b)_ _____A carryforward is considered the remaining portion of a_  
| _credit that cannot be claimed in the current year because of the_  
| _limitation under Section 171.703(c). A carryforward is added to_  
| _the next year's installment of the credit in determining the_  
| _limitation for that year. A credit carryforward from a previous_  
| _report is considered to be used before the current year_  
| _installment._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.705._ _____APPLICATION FOR CREDIT. (a) A qualified_  
| _entity must apply for a credit under this subchapter on or with the_

| _credit is claimed any information required by the comptroller to_  
| _sufficiently demonstrate that the entity is eligible for the_  
| _credit._  
|  _(c)_ _____The burden of establishing eligibility for and the value_  
| _of the credit is on the qualified entity._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.706._ _____SALE OR ASSIGNMENT OF CREDIT. (a) A_  
| _qualified entity that earns a credit under this subchapter may sell_  
| _or assign all or part of the credit, and any entity to which all or_

| _of the credit to another entity._ ___There is no limit on the total_  
| _number of transactions for the sale or assignment of all or part of_  
| _the total credit authorized under this subchapter, however,_  
| _collectively all transferred and retained credits claimed for a_  
| _period are subject to the limitation under Section 171.703(c)._  
|  _(b)_ _____An entity that sells or assigns a credit under this_  
| _section and the entity to which the credit is sold or assigned shall_  
| _jointly submit written notice of the sale or assignment to the_  
| _comptroller on a form promulgated by the comptroller not later than_  
| _the 30th day after the date of the sale or assignment. The notice_  
| _must include:_  
|  _(1) the date of the sale or assignment;_  
|  _(2) the amount of the credit sold or assigned;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the names and federal tax identification numbers_  
| _of the entity that sold or assigned the credit or part of the credit_  
| _and the entity to which the credit or part of the credit was sold or_  
| _assigned; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____the amount of the credit owned by the selling or_

|  _Sec._ ___171.707._ _____RULES. The comptroller shall adopt rules_  
| _necessary to implement this subchapter._  
|  SECTION 4. The legislature finds that, because of the many  
| different types of retail inventory and the differences in the  
| period of time that items comprising different types of retail  
| inventory are held for sale by retailers before being sold to  
| purchasers, it is difficult to establish a method that reliably  
| determines the market value of such inventory. Accordingly, the  
| legislature has enacted Section 23.1244, Tax Code, to specify a  
| fair and accurate method for determining the appraised value of  
| retail inventory that recognizes the unique characteristics of  
| different types of retail inventory that may affect its value.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 23.1244, Tax Code, as added by this Act,  
| applies only to an ad valorem tax year that begins on or after the  
| effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 6. Subchapter N, Chapter 171, Tax Code, as added by  
| this Act, applies only to a report originally due on or after  
| January 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

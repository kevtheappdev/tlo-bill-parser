|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the entry of a plea by defendants charged with certain  
| misdemeanors involving family violence.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 27.14(b), Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A defendant charged with a misdemeanor for which the  
| maximum possible punishment is by fine only may, in lieu of the  
| method provided in Subsection (a), mail or deliver in person to the  
| court a plea of "guilty" or a plea of "nolo contendere" and a waiver  
| of jury trial. The defendant may also request in writing that the  
| court notify the defendant, at the address stated in the request, of  
| the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. If the  
| court receives a plea and waiver before the time the defendant is  
| scheduled to appear in court, the court shall dispose of the case  
| without requiring a court appearance by the defendant. If the court  
| receives a plea and waiver after the time the defendant is scheduled  
| to appear in court but at least five business days before a  
| scheduled trial date, the court shall dispose of the case without  
| requiring a court appearance by the defendant. The court shall  
| notify the defendant either in person or by regular mail of the  
| amount of any fine or costs assessed in the case, information  
| regarding the alternatives to the full payment of any fine or costs  
| assessed against the defendant, if the defendant is unable to pay  
| that amount, and, if requested by the defendant, the amount of an  
| appeal bond that the court will approve. Except as otherwise  
| provided by this code, the defendant shall pay any fine or costs  
| assessed or give an appeal bond in the amount stated in the notice  
| before the 31st day after receiving the notice. _This subsection_  
| _does not apply to a defendant charged with a misdemeanor involving_  
| _family violence, as defined by Section 71.004, Family Code._  
|  SECTION 2. Article 27.14(e)(2), Code of Criminal Procedure,  
| is amended to read as follows:  
|  (2) The court may provide the admonishment under  
| Subdivision (1) orally or in writing[ ~~, except that if the defendant~~  
|  ~~is charged with a misdemeanor punishable by fine only, the~~  
|  ~~statement printed on a citation issued under Article 14.06(b) may~~  
|  ~~serve as the court admonishment required by this subsection~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter B, Chapter 45, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended by adding Article 45.0211 to read as follows:  
|  _Art._ ___45.0211._ _____PLEA BY DEFENDANT CHARGED WITH FAMILY_  
| _VIOLENCE OFFENSE. (a)_ ___In this article, "family violence" has the_  
| _meaning assigned by Section 71.004, Family Code._  
|  _(b)_ _____If a defendant is charged with an offense involving_  
| _family violence, the judge or justice must take the defendant's_  
| _plea in open court._  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the entry of a plea with respect to an offense committed on or  
| after the effective date of this Act.  The entry of a plea with  
| respect to an offense committed before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was  
| committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose. For purposes of this section, an offense was committed  
| before the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense  
| occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

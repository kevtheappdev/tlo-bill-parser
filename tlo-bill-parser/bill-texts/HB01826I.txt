---  
|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the procedure for amending or revoking certificates of  
| public convenience and necessity issued to certain water utilities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 13.254, Water Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 13.254. REVOCATION OR AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE. (a)  
| The utility commission at any time after notice and hearing may  
| revoke or amend any certificate of public convenience and  
| necessity _:_  
|  _(1)_ with the written consent of the certificate  
| holder _;_ or  
|  _(2)_ if the utility commission finds that:  
|  _(A)_ [ ~~(1)~~ ] the certificate holder has never  
| provided, is no longer providing, is incapable of providing, or has  
| failed to provide continuous and adequate service in the area, or  
| part of the area, covered by the certificate;  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~(2)~~ ] in an affected county as defined in  
| Section 16.341, the cost of providing service by the certificate  
| holder is so prohibitively expensive as to constitute denial of  
| service, provided that, for commercial developments or for  
| residential developments started after September 1, 1997, in an  
| affected county as defined in Section 16.341, the fact that the cost  
| of obtaining service from the currently certificated retail public  
| utility makes the development economically unfeasible does not  
| render such cost prohibitively expensive in the absence of other  
| relevant factors;  
|  _(C)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] the certificate holder has agreed in  
| writing to allow another retail public utility to provide service  
| within its service area, except for an interim period, without  
| amending its certificate; or  
|  _(D)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] the certificate holder has failed to  
| file a cease and desist action pursuant to Section 13.252 within 180  
| days of the date that it became aware that another retail public  
| utility was providing service within its service area, unless the  
| certificate holder demonstrates good cause for its failure to file  
| such action within the 180 days.  
|  _(b)_ _____For a proceeding under Subsection (a) in which another_  
| _retail public utility proposes to provide service in the_  
| _decertified area and the certificate holder has not agreed to the_  
| _decertification, the utility commission shall issue an initial_  
| _order to revoke or amend the certificate and follow the process in_  
| _this section to require that the alternate retail public utility_  
| _provide compensation to the certificate holder._  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ] As an alternative to decertification under  
| Subsection (a), the owner of a tract of land that is at least 50  
| acres and that is not in a platted subdivision actually receiving  
| water or sewer service may petition the utility commission under  
| this subsection for expedited release of the area from a  
| certificate of public convenience and necessity so that the area  
| may receive service from another retail public utility. The fact  
| that a certificate holder is a borrower under a federal loan program  
| is not a bar to a request under this subsection for the release of  
| the petitioner's land and the receipt of services from an  
| alternative provider. [ ~~On the day the petitioner submits the~~  
|  ~~petition to the utility commission, the petitioner shall send, via~~  
|  ~~certified mail, a copy of the petition to the certificate holder,~~  
|  ~~who may submit information to the utility commission to controvert~~  
|  ~~information submitted by the petitioner.~~ ] The petitioner must  
| demonstrate _in the petition_ that:  
|  (1) a written request for service, other than a  
| request for standard residential or commercial service, has been  
| submitted to the certificate holder, identifying:  
|  (A) the area for which service is sought;  
|  (B) the timeframe within which service is needed  
| for current and projected service demands in the area;  
|  (C) the level and manner of service needed for  
| current and projected service demands in the area;  
|  (D) the approximate cost for the alternative  
| provider to provide the service at the same level and manner that is  
| requested from the certificate holder;  
|  (E) the flow and pressure requirements and  
| specific infrastructure needs, including line size and system  
| capacity for the required level of fire protection requested; and  
|  (F) any additional information requested by the  
| certificate holder that is reasonably related to determination of  
| the capacity or cost for providing the service;  
|  (2) the certificate holder has been allowed at least  
| 90 calendar days to review and respond to the written request and  
| the information it contains;  
|  (3) the certificate holder:  
|  (A) has refused to provide the service;  
|  (B) is not capable of providing the service on a  
| continuous and adequate basis within the timeframe, at the level,  
| at the approximate cost that the alternative provider is capable of  
| providing for a comparable level of service, or in the manner  
| reasonably needed or requested by current and projected service  
| demands in the area; or  
|  (C) conditions the provision of service on the  
| payment of costs not properly allocable directly to the  
| petitioner's service request, as determined by the utility  
| commission; and  
|  (4) the alternate retail public utility from which the  
| petitioner will be requesting service possesses the financial,  
| managerial, and technical capability to provide continuous and  
| adequate service within the timeframe, at the level, at the cost,  
| and in the manner reasonably needed or requested by current and  
| projected service demands in the area.  
|  _(d)_ _____A landowner who intends to file a petition under_  
| _Subsection (c) shall provide to the certificate holder notice of_  
| _the landowner's intent to file the petition at least 30 days before_  
| _the date the landowner files the petition. The notice must specify_  
| _the tract of land to be decertified. On the day the landowner_  
| _submits the petition to the utility commission under Subsection_  
| _(c), the landowner by certified mail shall send a copy of the_  
| _petition to the certificate holder. The certificate holder may_  
| _submit to the utility commission information to controvert_  
| _information submitted by the landowner._  
|  _(e)_ [ ~~(a-2)~~ ] A landowner is not entitled to make the election  
| described in Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ] or _(h)_ [ ~~(a-5)~~ ] but is
entitled  
| to contest under Subsection (a) the involuntary certification of  
| its property in a hearing held by the utility commission if the  
| landowner's property is located:  
|  (1) within the boundaries of any municipality or the  
| extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality with a population  
| of more than 500,000 and the municipality or retail public utility  
| owned by the municipality is the holder of the certificate; or  
|  (2) in a platted subdivision actually receiving water  
| or sewer service.  
|  _(f) Not later than the 60th day after_ [ ~~(a-3) Within 60~~  
|  ~~calendar days from~~ ] the date the utility commission determines _a_  
| [ ~~the~~ ] petition filed pursuant to Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ] to be  
| administratively complete, the utility commission shall _issue an_  
| _initial order granting_ [ ~~grant~~ ] the petition unless the utility  
| commission makes an express finding that the petitioner failed to  
| satisfy the elements required in Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ] and  
| supports its finding with separate findings and conclusions for  
| each element based solely on the information provided by the  
| petitioner and the certificate holder. The utility commission may  
| grant or deny a petition subject to terms and conditions  
| specifically related to the service request of the petitioner and  
| all relevant information submitted by the petitioner and the  
| certificate holder. [ ~~In addition, the utility commission may~~  
|  ~~require an award of compensation as otherwise provided by this~~  
|  ~~section.~~ ]  
|  _(g)_ [ ~~(a-4)~~ ] Chapter 2001, Government Code, does not apply to  
| _a_ [ ~~any~~ ] petition filed under Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ]. The
decision  
| of the utility commission on the petition is final after any  
| reconsideration authorized by the utility commission's rules and  
| may not be appealed.  
|  _(h)_ [ ~~(a-5)~~ ] As an alternative to decertification under  
| Subsection (a) and expedited release under Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ],  
| the owner of a tract of land that is at least 25 acres and that is  
| not receiving water or sewer service may petition for expedited  
| release of the area from a certificate of public convenience and  
| necessity and is entitled to that release if the landowner's  
| property _:_  
|  _(1)_ is located in a county _:_  
|  _(A)_ with a population of at least one million _or_  
| _that is_ [ ~~, a county~~ ] adjacent to a county with a population of at  
| least one million _; or_  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~, or a county~~ ] with a population of more than  
| 200,000 and less than 220,000 that does not contain a public or  
| private university that had a total enrollment in the most recent  
| fall semester of 40,000 or more _; and_  
|  _(2) is not located_[ ~~, and not~~ ] in a county that has a  
| population of more than 45,500 and less than 47,500.  
|  _(i)_ _____A landowner who intends to file a petition under_  
| _Subsection (h) shall provide to the certificate holder notice of_  
| _the landowner's intent to file the petition at least 30 days before_  
| _the date the landowner files the petition. The notice must specify_  
| _the tract of land to be decertified._  
|  _(j)_ [ ~~(a-6)~~ ] The utility commission shall _issue an initial_  
| _order granting_ [ ~~grant~~ ] a petition received under Subsection _(h)_  
| [ ~~(a-5)~~ ] not later than the 60th day after the date the landowner  
| files the petition. The utility commission may not deny a petition  
| received under Subsection _(h)_ [ ~~(a-5)~~ ] based on the fact that a  
| certificate holder is a borrower under a federal loan program. [ ~~The~~  
|  ~~utility commission may require an award of compensation by the~~  
|  ~~petitioner to a decertified retail public utility that is the~~  
|  ~~subject of a petition filed under Subsection (a-5) as otherwise~~  
|  ~~provided by this section.~~ ]  
|  _(k) A_ [ ~~(a-7) The~~ ] utility shall include with the statement  
| of intent provided to each landowner or ratepayer a notice of:  
|  (1) a proceeding under this section related to  
| certification or decertification;  
|  (2) the reason or reasons for the proposed rate  
| change; and  
|  (3) any bill payment assistance program available to  
| low-income ratepayers.  
|  _(l)_ [ ~~(a-8)~~ ] If a certificate holder has never made service  
| available through planning, design, construction of facilities, or  
| contractual obligations to serve the area a petitioner seeks to  
| have released under Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ], the utility commission  
| is not required to find that the proposed alternative provider is  
| capable of providing better service than the certificate holder,  
| but only that the proposed alternative provider is capable of  
| providing the requested service.  
|  _(m)_ [ ~~(a-9)~~ ] Subsection _(l)_ [ ~~(a-8)~~ ] does not apply to a  
| county _:_  
|  _(1)_ that borders the United Mexican States and the  
| Gulf of Mexico or a county adjacent to a county that borders the  
| United Mexican States and the Gulf of Mexico _;_  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~.~~  
|  [ ~~(a-10) Subsection (a-8) does not apply to a county:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] with a population of more than 30,000 and less  
| than 35,000 that borders the Red River;  
|  _(3)_ [ ~~or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ] with a population of more than 100,000 and less  
| than 200,000 that borders a county described by Subdivision _(2);_  
|  _(4)_ [ ~~(1).~~  
|  [ ~~(a-11) Subsection (a-8) does not apply to a county:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] with a population of 130,000 or more that is  
| adjacent to a county with a population of 1.5 million or more that  
| is within 200 miles of an international border; or  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(2)~~ ] with a population of more than 40,000 and  
| less than 50,000 that contains a portion of the San Antonio River.  
|  _(n)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] Upon written request from the certificate holder,  
| the utility commission may cancel the certificate of a utility or  
| water supply corporation authorized by rule to operate without a  
| certificate of public convenience and necessity under Section  
| 13.242(c).  
|  _(o)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] If the certificate of any retail public utility is  
| revoked or amended _under this section_ , the utility commission may  
| require one or more retail public utilities with their consent to  
| provide service in the _decertified_ area [ ~~in question~~ ]. _An_ [
~~The~~ ]  
| order of the utility commission _issued under this subsection_ shall  
| not be effective to transfer property.  
|  _(p)_ _____In an initial order issued under Subsection (b), (f), or_  
| _(j), the utility commission shall require the certificate holder,_  
| _not later than the 20th day after the date the order is issued, to_  
| _submit to the utility commission and, as applicable, the petitioner_  
| _and any retail public utility that intends to provide service to the_  
| _decertified area the following information, which must be current_  
| _as of the date the information is provided:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the number of potable water connections the_  
| _certificate holder could have served in the decertified area at a_  
| _density of one connection per acre while maintaining 0.6 gallons_  
| _per minute of potable water supply to each connection with the_  
| _groundwater supply, surface water supply, and treated water_  
| _purchase contract supply available to the certificate holder;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the number of wastewater connections the_  
| _certificate holder could have served in the decertified area at a_  
| _density of one connection per acre while maintaining 200 gallons_  
| _per day of wastewater treatment capacity to each connection with_  
| _the combined wastewater treatment plant capacity and wastewater_  
| _treatment wholesale contract capacity available to the certificate_  
| _holder;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the certificate holder's base monthly retail rate;_  
| _and_  
|  _(4)_ _____any additional supporting evidence or_  
| _documentation for the information described by Subdivision (1),_  
| _(2), or (3) if required by the utility commission._  
|  _(q)_ _____Not later than the 30th day after the date the utility_  
| _commission receives the information required to be submitted under_  
| _Subsection (p), the utility commission shall issue a second order_  
| _requiring that just and adequate compensation be paid to the_  
| _certificate holder and establishing the amount of compensation._  
| _Compensation is just and adequate if the compensation is in an_  
| _amount equal to the certificate holder's base monthly retail rate_  
| _multiplied by the number of water and wastewater connections the_  
| _certificate holder could have served in the decertified area for a_  
| _period of 10 years. For an area decertified under Subsection (a),_  
| _the alternate retail public utility that intends to serve the area_  
| _shall pay the compensation. For an area decertified under_  
| _Subsection (c) or (h), the petitioner shall pay the compensation._  
|  _(r)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (q), the retail public_  
| _utility or petitioner may, before the date the utility commission_  
| _is authorized to issue a second order under Subsection (q), request_  
| _that the utility commission notify the retail public utility or_  
| _petitioner of the amount of compensation the utility commission_  
| _intends to order and request a hearing on the issue of compensation_  
| _before the utility commission to be held before the second order may_  
| _be issued. The utility commission is not required to hold the_  
| _hearing unless the requestor deposits the amount of compensation_  
| _the utility commission intends to order into the registry of the_  
| _district court of Travis County, pending the outcome of the_  
| _hearing._  
|  _(s)_ _____The utility commission shall conduct a hearing under_  
| _Subsection (r) not later than the 60th day after the date of the_  
| _request. At the hearing, the utility commission shall consider_  
| _evidence relating to all information submitted under Subsection_  
| _(p). The utility commission shall issue the second order after the_  
| _hearing._  
|  _(t)_ _____When compensation has been paid according to the_  
| _requirements of the second order, the utility commission shall_  
| _issue a third order to finalize the decertification of the retail_  
| _public utility. The third order must be made effective as of the_  
| _date the compensation is paid._  
|  _(u)_ [ ~~(d)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~A retail public utility may not in any way
render~~  
|  ~~retail water or sewer service directly or indirectly to the public~~  
|  ~~in an area that has been decertified under this section without~~  
|  ~~providing compensation for any property that the utility commission~~  
|  ~~determines is rendered useless or valueless to the decertified~~  
|  ~~retail public utility as a result of the decertification.~~  
|  [ ~~(e)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~The determination of the monetary amount of~~  
|  ~~compensation, if any, shall be determined at the time another~~  
|  ~~retail public utility seeks to provide service in the previously~~  
|  ~~decertified area and before service is actually provided. The~~  
|  ~~utility commission shall ensure that the monetary amount of~~  
|  ~~compensation is determined not later than the 90th calendar day~~  
|  ~~after the date on which a retail public utility notifies the utility~~  
|  ~~commission of its intent to provide service to the decertified~~  
|  ~~area.~~  
|  [ ~~(f)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~The monetary amount shall be determined by a
qualified~~  
|  ~~individual or firm serving as independent appraiser agreed upon by~~  
|  ~~the decertified retail public utility and the retail public utility~~  
|  ~~seeking to serve the area. The determination of compensation by the~~  
|  ~~independent appraiser shall be binding on the utility commission.~~  
|  ~~The costs of the independent appraiser shall be borne by the retail~~  
|  ~~public utility seeking to serve the area.~~  
|  [ ~~(g)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~For the purpose of implementing this section, the
value~~  
|  ~~of real property owned and utilized by the retail public utility for~~  
|  ~~its facilities shall be determined according to the standards set~~  
|  ~~forth in Chapter 21, Property Code, governing actions in eminent~~  
|  ~~domain and the value of personal property shall be determined~~  
|  ~~according to the factors in this subsection. The factors ensuring~~  
|  ~~that the compensation to a retail public utility is just and~~  
|  ~~adequate shall include: the amount of the retail public utility's~~  
|  ~~debt allocable for service to the area in question; the value of the~~  
|  ~~service facilities of the retail public utility located within the~~  
|  ~~area in question; the amount of any expenditures for planning,~~  
|  ~~design, or construction of service facilities that are allocable to~~  
|  ~~service to the area in question; the amount of the retail public~~  
|  ~~utility's contractual obligations allocable to the area in~~  
|  ~~question; any demonstrated impairment of service or increase of~~  
|  ~~cost to consumers of the retail public utility remaining after the~~  
|  ~~decertification; the impact on future revenues lost from existing~~  
|  ~~customers; necessary and reasonable legal expenses and~~  
|  ~~professional fees; and other relevant factors. The utility~~  
|  ~~commission shall adopt rules governing the evaluation of these~~  
|  ~~factors.~~  
|  [ ~~(g-1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~If the retail public utilities cannot agree on an~~  
|  ~~independent appraiser within 10 calendar days after the date on~~  
|  ~~which the retail public utility notifies the utility commission of~~  
|  ~~its intent to provide service to the decertified area, each retail~~  
|  ~~public utility shall engage its own appraiser at its own expense,~~  
|  ~~and each appraisal shall be submitted to the utility commission~~  
|  ~~within 60 calendar days. After receiving the appraisals, the~~  
|  ~~utility commission shall appoint a third appraiser who shall make a~~  
|  ~~determination of the compensation within 30 days. The determination~~  
|  ~~may not be less than the lower appraisal or more than the higher~~  
|  ~~appraisal. Each retail public utility shall pay half the cost of the~~  
|  ~~third appraisal.~~  
|  [ ~~(h)~~ ] A certificate holder that has land removed from its  
| certificated service area in accordance with this section may not  
| be required, after the land is removed, to provide service to the  
| removed land for any reason, including the violation of law or  
| utility commission or commission rules by a water or sewer system of  
| another person.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a proceeding affecting a certificate of public convenience and  
| necessity that commences on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| A proceeding affecting a certificate of public convenience and  
| necessity that commenced before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the proceeding is  
| commenced, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

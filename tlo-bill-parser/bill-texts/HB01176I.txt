|  (5) execution and delivery of the instrument by a  
| corporation, partnership, or other company that had been dissolved,  
| whose charter had expired, or whose franchise had been canceled,  
| withdrawn, or forfeited;

| acknowledgment or jurat that complies with applicable law; or  
|  (9) wording of the stated consideration that may or  
| might create an implied lien in favor of the grantor.  
|  (c) For the purposes of this section, an instrument  
| affecting real property containing a [ ~~ministerial~~ ] defect _in_ ,  
| omission _of_ , or informality in the [ ~~certificate of~~ ] acknowledgment  
| that has been filed for record for longer than _six months_ [ ~~two~~

| after the date the instrument is filed.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an instrument filed for record on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. An instrument filed for record before the effective date  
| of this Act is governed by the law in effect immediately before the  
| effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a request for binding arbitration to appeal appraisal  
| review board orders involving two or more contiguous tracts of  
| land.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 41A.03(a-1), Tax Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a-1) If a property owner requests binding arbitration  
| under this chapter to appeal appraisal review board orders  
| involving two or more tracts of land that are contiguous to one  
| another, a single arbitration deposit in the amount provided by  
| Subsection (a)(2) is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of  
| Subsection (a)(2).  _For purposes of this subsection, tracts of land_  
| _may not be considered to be noncontiguous on the basis of the_  
| _classifications of the tracts of land, provided that the tracts of_  
| _land constitute the same economic unit._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a request for binding arbitration under Chapter 41A, Tax Code, that  
| is filed on or after the effective date of this Act. A request for  
| binding arbitration under Chapter 41A, Tax Code, that is filed  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect on the date the request is filed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

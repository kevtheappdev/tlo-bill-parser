|  SECTION 3. Section 42.0704, Human Resources Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 42.0704. ENFORCEMENT POLICY. (a)  The executive  
| commissioner by rule shall adopt a general enforcement policy that  
| describes the _commission's_ [ ~~department's~~ ] approach to enforcement  
| of this chapter.  
|  (b) The enforcement policy must:

| expectations in enforcing this chapter;  
|  (2) include the methodology required by Subsection

| [ ~~department~~ ] shall develop and implement a methodology for  
| determining the appropriate disciplinary action to take against a

| The methodology must provide guidance on when to use each of the  
| available tools of enforcement, including technical assistance,  
| voluntary plans of action, [ ~~evaluation,~~ ] probation, suspension or  
| revocation of a license or registration, denial of a license or  
| registration, administrative penalties, and emergency suspension.  
| The methodology must allow the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] to consider  
| the circumstances of a particular case, including the nature and  
| seriousness of the violation, history of previous violations, and  
| aggravating and mitigating factors, in determining the appropriate  
| disciplinary action.  
|  (d) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall make the methodology  
| described by Subsection (c) available to the public, including by

|  SECTION 4. Section 42.071, Human Resources Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 42.071. SUSPENSION[ ~~, EVALUATION,~~ ] OR PROBATION OF  
| LICENSE OR REGISTRATION.  (a) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may  
| suspend the license of a facility or the registration of a family  
| home that has temporarily ceased operation but has definite plans  
| for starting operations again within the time limits of the issued  
| license or registration.  
|  (b) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may suspend a facility's  
| license or a family home's registration for a definite period  
| rather than deny or revoke the license or registration if the  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] finds repeated noncompliance with  
| standards that do not endanger the health and safety of children.  
| To qualify for license or registration suspension under this  
| subsection, a facility or family home must suspend its operations  
| and show that standards can be met within the suspension period.  
|  (c) If the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] finds a facility or  
| family home is in repeated noncompliance with standards that do not  
| endanger the health and safety of children, the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] may _place_ [ ~~schedule~~ ] the facility or family home
_on_  
| [ ~~for evaluation or~~ ] probation rather than suspend or revoke the  
| facility's license or the family home's registration. The  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall provide notice to the facility or  
| family home of the [ ~~evaluation or~~ ] probation and of the items of  
| noncompliance not later than the 10th day before the [ ~~evaluation~~  
|  ~~or~~ ] probation period begins. [ ~~The department shall designate a~~  
|  ~~period of not less than 30 days during which the facility or family~~  
|  ~~home will remain under evaluation.~~ ] During the [ ~~evaluation or~~ ]  
| probation period, the facility or family home must correct the  
| items that were in noncompliance and report the corrections to the  
| _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] for approval.  
|  (d) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall revoke the license of  
| a facility or the registration of a family home that does not comply  
| with standards at the end of a license or registration suspension.  
|  (e) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may suspend or revoke the  
| license of a facility or the registration of a family home that does  
| not correct items that were in noncompliance or that does not comply  
| with required standards within the applicable [ ~~evaluation or~~ ]  
| probation period.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 42.078, Human Resources Code, is amended  
| by amending Subsections (a), (a-2), and (c) and adding Subsection  
| (b-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may impose [ ~~an~~  
|  ~~administrative sanction or~~ ] an administrative penalty against a  
| facility or family home licensed, registered, or listed under this  
| chapter that violates this chapter _or other law_ or a _commission_ rule  
| [ ~~or order adopted under this chapter~~ ]. In addition, the _commission_  
| [ ~~department~~ ] may impose an administrative penalty against a  
| facility or family home or a controlling person of a facility or  
| family home if the facility, family home, or controlling person:  
|  (1) violates a term of a license or registration  
| issued under this chapter;  
|  (2) makes a statement about a material fact that the  
| facility _, family home,_ or person knows or should know is false:  
|  (A) on an application for the issuance _or renewal_  
| of a license or registration or an attachment to the application; or  
|  (B) in response to a matter under investigation  
| _by the commission or the department_ ;  
|  (3) refuses to allow a representative of the  
| _commission or_ department to inspect:  
|  (A) a book, record, or file [ ~~required to be~~ ]  
| maintained by the facility _or family home_ ; or  
|  (B) any part of the premises of the facility _or_  
| _family home_ ;

|  _(A)_ the work of a representative of the  
| _commission or_ department _;_ or  
|  _(B)_ the enforcement of this chapter; or  
|  (5) fails to pay a penalty assessed under this chapter  
| on or before the date the penalty is due, as determined under this  
| section.  
|  (a-2) The _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] may impose an  
| administrative penalty without first imposing a nonmonetary  
| administrative sanction for violating a minimum standard  
| applicable to a facility or family home under this chapter that is  
| determined by the _commission_ [ ~~department~~ ] to be a high-risk  
| standard, including background check standards, safety hazard  
| standards, and supervision standards.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The executive commissioner shall, in consultation_  
| _with appropriate interested parties, adopt rules on the imposition_  
| _of an administrative penalty under this section. The rules must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____specify the types of violations that warrant_  
| _imposition of an administrative penalty by examining the scope and_  
| _severity of the relevant minimum standard violated;_  
|  _(2)_ _____prescribe reasonable penalty amounts, subject to_  
| _Subdivision (4), to be imposed for each violation subject to an_  
| _administrative penalty;_  
|  _(3)_ _____establish a schedule of progressive_  
| _administrative penalties and amounts, subject to Subdivision (4),_  
| _in accordance with the type, frequency, and seriousness of a_  
| _violation;_  
|  _(4)_ _____authorize the imposition of an administrative_  
| _penalty in an amount not to exceed:_  
|  _(A) $500 for a first violation; and_  
|  _(B) $2,000 for progressive violations;_  
|  _(5)_ _____provide that a facility or family home commits a_  
| _separate violation each day the facility or home continues to_  
| _violate the law or rule;_  
|  _(6)_ _____ensure standard and consistent application of the_  
| _administrative penalties throughout the state; and_  
|  _(7)_ _____provide for an administrative appeals process in_  
| _accordance with Chapter 2001, Government Code, to adjudicate claims_  
| _and appeals relating to the imposition of an administrative penalty_  
| _under this section._  
|  (c) In _determining_ [ ~~addition to the number of children,~~ ] the  
| amount of the penalty _, the commission_ shall _consider_ [ ~~be based on~~
]:  
|  (1) the seriousness of the violation, including the  
| nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of any prohibited acts,  
| and the hazard or potential hazard created to the health _and_ [ ~~,~~ ]  
| safety _of the children to whom the facility or family home provides_  
| _care_ [ ~~, or economic welfare of the public~~ ];  
|  (2) _the number of children to whom the facility or_  
| _family home was authorized to provide care or the number of children_  
| _under the care of the child-placing agency when the violation_  
| _occurred_ [ ~~the economic harm to property or the environment caused~~  
|  ~~by the violation~~ ];  
|  (3) the history of previous violations;  
|  (4) the amount necessary to deter future violations;  
|  (5) _the_ efforts to correct the violation; and  
|  (6) any other matter that justice may require.  
|  SECTION 6. Sections 42.078(a-1), (b), (e), (f), (g), (h),  
| (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), and (q), Human Resources  
| Code, are repealed.

| _provided by Section 11.13(c) for an individual who is disabled dies_  
| _on or after January 1, 2013,_ the surviving spouse of the individual  
| is entitled to the limitation applicable to the residence homestead  
| of the individual if:  
|  (1) the surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older  
| when the individual dies; and  
|  (2) the residence homestead of the individual:  
|  (A) is the residence homestead of the surviving  
| spouse on the date that the individual dies; and

|  _(i-1)_ _____A limitation under Subsection (i) applicable to the_  
| _residence homestead of the surviving spouse of an individual who_  
| _was disabled and who died on or after January 1, 2013, but before_  
| _January 1, 2020, is calculated as if the surviving spouse was_  
| _entitled to the limitation when the individual died._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, to allow the surviving spouse of a person who  
| is disabled to receive a limitation on the school district ad  
| valorem taxes on the spouse's residence homestead if the spouse is  
| 55 years of age or older at the time of the person's death is  
| approved by the voters. If that constitutional amendment is not  
| approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

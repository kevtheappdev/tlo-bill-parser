|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the acquisition of property by an entity with eminent  
| domain authority.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 21.0111, Property Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsection (a-1) to read as follows:  
|  _(a-1)_ _____After making an offer to which Subsection (a) applies,_  
| _the entity shall disclose to the property owner any new, amended, or_  
| _updated appraisal report produced or acquired by or on behalf of the_  
| _entity after making the offer and used in determining the entity's_  
| _opinion of value._ ___A disclosure required by this subsection must be_  
| _made not later than the earlier of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the 10th day after the date the entity receives the_  
| _appraisal report; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the third business day before the date of a special_  
| _commissioner's hearing if the appraisal report is to be used at the_  
| _hearing._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 21.012, Property Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsection (d) to read as follows:  
|  _(d)_ _____In accordance with Section 21.019(b-1), a court shall_  
| _dismiss a condemnation proceeding unless the entity that files a_  
| _petition under this section proves to the court that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the petition meets the requirements of Subsection_  
| _(b); and_  
|  _(2) the entity complied with Subsection (c)._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 21.019, Property Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (b), and (c) and adding Subsection (b-1)  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) A party that files a condemnation petition may move to  
| dismiss _, wholly or partly,_ the proceedings, and the court shall  
| conduct a hearing on the motion. However, after the special  
| commissioners have made an award, in an effort to obtain a lower  
| award a condemnor may not dismiss _, wholly or partly,_ the  
| condemnation proceedings merely to institute new proceedings that  
| involve substantially the same condemnation against the same  
| property owner.  
|  (b) A court that hears and grants a motion to dismiss _,_  
| _wholly or partly,_ a condemnation proceeding made by a condemnor  
| under Subsection (a) shall make an allowance to the property owner  
| for reasonable and necessary fees for attorneys, appraisers, and  
| photographers and for the other expenses incurred by the property  
| owner to the date of the hearing.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The court shall dismiss a condemnation proceeding if_  
| _the court finds that the party that filed the condemnation petition_  
| _failed to comply with any provision of Section 21.0111, 21.0112,_  
| _21.0113, or 21.012. A court that grants a motion to dismiss under_  
| _this subsection shall make an allowance to the property owner for_  
| _reasonable and necessary fees for attorneys, appraisers, and_  
| _photographers and for the other expenses incurred by the property_  
| _owner to the date of the hearing._  
|  (c) _Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), a_ [ ~~A~~ ] court that  
| hears and grants a motion to dismiss a condemnation proceeding made  
| by a property owner seeking a judicial denial of the right to  
| condemn or that otherwise renders a judgment denying the right to  
| condemn may make an allowance to the property owner for reasonable  
| and necessary fees for attorneys, appraisers, and photographers and  
| for the other expenses incurred by the property owner to the date of  
| the hearing or judgment.  
|  SECTION 4. Sections 21.0195(b) and (c), Property Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) The department may move to dismiss _, wholly or partly,_ a  
| proceeding it files, and the court shall conduct a hearing on the  
| motion. The court may grant the motion only if the court determines  
| that the property owner's interest will not be materially affected  
| by the dismissal. The department may not dismiss _, wholly or partly,_  
| the condemnation proceedings merely to institute new proceedings  
| that involve substantially the same condemnation against the same  
| property owner solely to obtain a lower condemnation award.  
|  (c) If a court dismisses _, wholly or partly,_ a condemnation  
| proceeding on the motion of the department or as a result of the  
| failure of the department to bring the proceeding properly, the  
| court shall make an allowance to the property owner for the value of  
| the department's use of the property while in possession of the  
| property, any damage that the condemnation has caused to the  
| property owner, and any expenses the property owner has incurred in  
| connection with the condemnation, including reasonable and  
| necessary fees for attorneys.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 21.047(d), Property Code, is repealed.  
|  SECTION 6. (a) Section 21.0111, Property Code, as amended  
| by this Act, applies only to the acquisition of real property in  
| connection with an initial offer made under Section 21.0113,  
| Property Code, on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  (b) Sections 21.012, 21.019, and 21.0195, Property Code, as  
| amended by this Act, and the repeal of Section 21.047(d), Property  
| Code, by this Act apply only to an eminent domain proceeding  
| commenced on or after the effective date of this Act. An eminent  
| domain proceeding commenced before the effective date of this Act  
| is governed by the law applicable to the proceeding immediately  
| before the effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect December 1, 2019.

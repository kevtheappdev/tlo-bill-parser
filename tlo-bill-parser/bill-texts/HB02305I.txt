|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a work group on enhancing the training and  
| credentialing of emergency management personnel.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS. In this Act:  
|  (1) "Disaster" has the meaning assigned by Section  
| 418.004, Government Code.  
|  (2) "Emergency management director" and "emergency  
| management coordinator" mean the director and coordinator,  
| respectively, designated under Section 418.1015, Government Code.  
|  (3) "Work group" means the work group established  
| under Section 2 of this Act.  
|  SECTION 2. WORK GROUP. The Texas Division of Emergency  
| Management shall establish a work group of persons knowledgeable on  
| emergency management to study and develop a proposal for enhancing  
| the training and credentialing of emergency management directors,  
| emergency management coordinators, and other emergency management  
| personnel on the state or local level.  
|  SECTION 3. STUDY AND PROPOSAL. (a)  As part of the study and  
| proposal under Section 2 of this Act, the work group shall:  
|  (1) assess the training and credentials necessary for  
| emergency management directors, emergency management coordinators,  
| and other emergency management personnel on the state or local  
| level to effectively oversee the response to and recovery from a  
| disaster, including reviewing, in consultation with the Texas A&M  
| Engineering Extension Service, current required training courses;  
| and  
|  (2) consult with Texas A&M University and other  
| institutions of higher education, as defined by Section 61.003,  
| Education Code, as appropriate, on the development of degree  
| programs in emergency management in addition to the programs that  
| exist in this state on the effective date of this Act.  
|  (b) In conducting the assessment required by Subsection  
| (a)(1) of this section, the work group shall consider:  
|  (1) whether the differences in geography, population,  
| and critical infrastructure between emergency management  
| directors' or emergency management coordinators' jurisdictions  
| warrant different levels of training and credentialing;  
|  (2) whether the legislature should enact laws  
| requiring an emergency management director or emergency management  
| coordinator to participate in emergency management training and  
| credentialing before overseeing the response to and recovery from a  
| disaster;  
|  (3) whether to include in any training required under  
| Subdivision (2) of this subsection information on disaster finance,  
| damage assessment, disaster contracting, debris management, and  
| skills needed to participate in federal emergency management  
| programs;  
|  (4) whether to implement incentives for emergency  
| management directors, emergency management coordinators, and any  
| other emergency management personnel to complete additional  
| training and continuing education; and  
|  (5) proposals for paying the cost for training for  
| emergency management directors and emergency management  
| coordinators that is more rigorous than the training required by  
| law for the directors and coordinators on the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  (c) Not later than November 1, 2020, the work group shall  
| submit the proposal required under this section to:  
|  (1) members of the legislature; and  
|  (2) the governor.  
|  SECTION 4. EXPIRATION. The work group is abolished and this  
| Act expires January 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect September  
| 1, 2019.

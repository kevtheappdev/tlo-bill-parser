| _or commercial property insurance_ during the initial policy term  
| after the 60th day following the date on which the policy was  
| issued.  
|  (c) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an insurer may  
| cancel a liability insurance _or commercial property insurance_  
| policy at any time during the term of the policy for:  
|  (1) fraud in obtaining coverage;  
|  (2) failure to pay premiums when due;  
|  (3) an increase in hazard within the control of the  
| insured that would produce a rate increase; or  
|  (4) loss of the insurer's reinsurance covering all or  
| part of the risk covered by the policy.  
|  (d) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an insurer may  
| cancel a liability insurance _or commercial property insurance_  
| policy at any time during the term of the policy if the insurer is  
| placed in supervision, conservatorship, or receivership and the  
| cancellation or nonrenewal is approved or directed by the  
| supervisor, conservator, or receiver.  
|  Sec. 551.053. WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION REQUIRED. Not  
| later than the 10th day before the date on which the cancellation of  
| a liability insurance _or commercial property insurance_ policy takes  
| effect, an insurer must deliver or mail written notice of the  
| cancellation to the first-named insured under the policy at the  
| address shown on the policy.

| to read as follows:  
|  (a) An insurer may refuse to renew a liability insurance _or_

| under the policy at the address shown on the policy.  
|  SECTION 5. Subchapter B, Chapter 551, Insurance Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 551.056 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___551.056._ _____CHANGES TO POLICY ON RENEWAL. (a) In this_  
| _section, "material change" means a change to a policy that, with_  
| _respect to a previous or existing policy:_  
|  _(1) reduces coverage;_  
|  _(2) changes conditions of coverage; or_  
|  _(3) changes the duties of the insured._  
|  _(b)_ _____A change to a liability insurance or commercial property_  
| _insurance policy provision on renewal is not a nonrenewal or_  
| _cancellation under this subchapter if the insurer provides the_  
| _insured with written notice in accordance with this section of any_  
| _material change in each form of the policy offered to the insured on_  
| _renewal from the form of the policy held immediately before_  
| _renewal._  
|  _(c) Notice provided under Subsection (b) must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____appear in a conspicuous place in the notice of_  
| _renewal;_  
|  _(2)_ _____clearly indicate each material change to the_  
| _policy being made on renewal;_  
|  _(3) be written in plain language; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____be provided to the insured not later than the 30th_  
| _day before the renewal date._  
|  _(d)_ _____In addition to the notice to the insured provided under_  
| _Subsection (b), if an insurer elects to make a material change to a_  
| _policy form on renewal, not later than the 30th day before the_  
| _earliest renewal date on which the new policy form is used, the_  
| _insurer shall provide written notice to each agent of the insurer_  
| _that clearly indicates each material change being made to the_  
| _policy form. An insurer may provide the notice to the agents in a_  
| _single notice given to each agent of the insurer that summarizes_  
| _substantially similar material changes to more than one policy_  
| _form._  
|  SECTION 6. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an insurance policy delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed  
| on or after January 1, 2020. A policy delivered, issued for  
| delivery, or renewed before that date is governed by the law as it  
| existed immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

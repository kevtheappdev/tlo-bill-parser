|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to legislative review of certain state agency rules.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 2001, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 2001.0321 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___2001.0321._ _____LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF CERTAIN PROPOSED_  
| _RULES. (a) This section applies only to a rule proposed by a state_  
| _agency that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____if implemented by the agency would result in the_  
| _imposition of a civil or criminal penalty, including a penalty_  
| _consisting only of a fine, on a person who violates the rule; and_  
|  _(2) is not an emergency rule._  
|  _(b)_ _____A state agency shall file, on the same day it files_  
| _notice with the secretary of state as required by Section 2001.023,_  
| _a copy of each proposed rule with the officer or employee with whom_  
| _bills are filed in each house of the legislature. After filing, the_  
| _proposed rule shall be referred to a standing committee in the same_  
| _manner as bills are referred, unless a house by rule provides for_  
| _another manner of referral of agency rules. Each proposed rule must_  
| _be referred to a standing committee before the 10th day after the_  
| _date the rule is filed with the appropriate officer or employee of_  
| _each house._  
|  _(c)_ _____After a proposed rule is referred to a committee, a_  
| _member of the legislature may request in writing that a committee to_  
| _which a proposed rule has been referred consider the rule at a_  
| _committee meeting. A committee shall consider any proposed rule_  
| _that is the subject of a written request at a committee meeting held_  
| _not later than the 30th day after the date on which the request is_  
| _made. If a written request of a member relating to a proposed rule_  
| _is not filed with the committee on or before the 30th day after the_  
| _date the rule is referred to the committee, the committee and the_  
| _house of which the committee is a part may not suspend the rule_  
| _under this section._  
|  _(d)_ _____After consideration at a committee meeting, a committee_  
| _may suspend a proposed rule by a majority vote of the committee's_  
| _full membership. If a proposed rule is suspended in committee, the_  
| _committee shall, not later than the third day after the date the_  
| _rule is suspended:_  
|  _(1)_ _____notify the state agency that proposed the rule of_  
| _the suspension; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____file notice of the suspension with the secretary_  
| _of state for publication in the Texas Register._  
|  _(e)_ _____If a proposed rule is suspended in committee when the_  
| _legislature is in session, the chair of the committee shall give_  
| _written notice of the suspension to the presiding officer of the_  
| _appropriate house not later than the fifth day after the date the_  
| _rule is suspended. Not later than the 35th day after the date the_  
| _proposed rule is suspended in committee, the members of that house_  
| _shall vote on the rule. If a majority of members of that house vote_  
| _to approve the proposed rule, the rule is approved and the_  
| _committee's suspension terminates. If a majority of members of_  
| _that house do not vote to approve the proposed rule, the committee's_  
| _suspension remains in effect._  
|  _(f)_ _____If a proposed rule is suspended in committee when the_  
| _legislature is not in session, the secretary of state shall give_  
| _written notice of the suspension to the presiding officer of the_  
| _appropriate house during the first 10 days of the next regular_  
| _legislative session. Not later than the 30th day after the date the_  
| _notice is given, the members of that house shall vote on the_  
| _proposed rule. If a majority of members of that house vote to_  
| _approve the proposed rule, the rule is approved and the committee's_  
| _suspension terminates. If a majority of members of that house do_  
| _not vote to approve the proposed rule, the committee's suspension_  
| _remains in effect._  
|  _(g)_ _____Not later than the third day after the date a suspension_  
| _is terminated under Subsection (e) or (f), the presiding officer of_  
| _the appropriate house shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____notify the state agency that proposed the rule of_  
| _the suspension's termination; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____file notice of the termination with the secretary_  
| _of state for publication in the Texas Register._  
|  _(h)_ _____During the time a proposed rule is suspended under this_  
| _section, the state agency that proposed the rule may not adopt an_  
| _emergency rule containing the substance of the suspended rule._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2001.0321, Government Code, as added by  
| this Act, applies only to a proposed state agency rule to which that  
| section applies and for which notice of the rule as proposed is  
| first published in the Texas Register under Section 2001.023,  
| Government Code, on or after the effective date of this Act.  A rule  
| to which Section 2001.0321, Government Code, as added by this Act,  
| applies and for which notice is published before the effective date  
| of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the notice was  
| published, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| legislative review or approval of state agency rules is approved by  
| the voters.  If that proposed constitutional amendment is not  
| approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

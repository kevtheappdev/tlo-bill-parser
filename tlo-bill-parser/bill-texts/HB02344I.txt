| relating to evidence sufficient for the issuance of a stalking  
| protective order.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 7A.03, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Subsection (c) to read as follows:  
|  _(c)_ _____A court may not find that there are reasonable grounds_  
| _to believe that the applicant is the victim of stalking solely based_  
| _on the content of an electronic communication unless the_  
| _communication threatens harm to the applicant, a member of the_  
| _applicant's family or household, the applicant's pet or property,_  
| _or another person. For purposes of this subsection, "electronic_  
| _communication" has the meaning assigned by Section 42.07, Penal_  
| _Code._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an application for a protective order submitted on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. An application submitted before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the application was submitted, and the former law is continued  
| in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

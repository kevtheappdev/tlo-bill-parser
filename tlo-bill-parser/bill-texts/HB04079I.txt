|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the terms and renewal of oyster certificates of  
| location.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 76.018(a) and (b), Parks and Wildlife  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The term of a rental lease for a location under this  
| subchapter is _five_ [ ~~15~~ ] years _or a term set by the commission_.  
|  (b) The commission shall determine renewal procedures to  
| follow at the end of each lease term. The procedures must include:  
|  (1) a determination that the lease renewal will be  
| based on the need for depuration of polluted oysters and other  
| considerations specified in the oyster management plan;  
|  (2) _an auction procedure to determine the fair market_  
| _value of the area under location that is up for renewal;_  
|  _(3)_ payment of a $200 fee due on renewal of the lease;  
|  _(4)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] a condition that the current leaseholder  
| will be offered a first right of refusal _at the fair market value_  
| _determined by the auction procedure required by Subdivision (2)_ if  
| the lease is renewed under this chapter; and  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] any other conditions for the lease renewal  
| that do not conflict with this chapter.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act to Section  
| 76.018, Parks and Wildlife Code, apply only to the rental lease for  
| an oyster certificate of location renewed on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. A rental lease for an oyster certificate of  
| location renewed before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the lease was renewed, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  ~~area to be annexed. The municipality shall provide the services by~~  
|  ~~any of the methods by which it extends the services to any other~~  
|  ~~area of the municipality~~ ].  
|  (b) The service plan, which must be completed [ ~~in the period~~  
|  ~~provided by Subsection (a)~~ ] before the annexation, must include a  
| program under which the municipality will provide full municipal  
| services in the annexed area no later than 2-1/2 years after the

| proposes a schedule to extend the period for providing certain  
| services, the schedule must provide for the provision of full  
| municipal services no later than 4-1/2 years after the effective  
| date of the annexation. However, under the program if the

| conditions or subsequent occurrences. An amended service plan must  
| provide for services that are comparable to or better than those  
| established in the service plan before amendment. Before any

|  SECTION 2.09. Section 43.0715(c), Local Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) At the time notice of the municipality's intent to annex

| municipality shall proceed to initiate and complete a report for  
| each developer conducted in accordance with the format approved by  
| the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for audits. In the  
| event the municipality is unable to complete the report prior to the  
| effective date of the annexation as a result of the developer's  
| failure to provide information to the municipality which cannot be  
| obtained from other sources, the municipality shall obtain from the  
| district the estimated costs of each project previously undertaken  
| by a developer which are eligible for reimbursement. The amount of  
| such costs, as estimated by the district, shall be escrowed by the  
| municipality for the benefit of the persons entitled to receive  
| payment in an insured interest-bearing account with a financial  
| institution authorized to do business in the state. To compensate  
| the developer for the municipality's use of the infrastructure  
| facilities pending the determination of the reimbursement amount,  
| all interest accrued on the escrowed funds shall be paid to the  
| developer whether or not the annexation is valid. Upon placement  
| of the funds in the escrow account, the annexation may become  
| effective. In the event a municipality timely escrows all  
| estimated reimbursable amounts as required by this subsection and  
| all such amounts, determined to be owed, including interest, are  
| subsequently disbursed to the developer within five days of final  
| determination in immediately available funds as required by this  
| section, no penalties or interest shall accrue during the pendency  
| of the escrow. Either the municipality or developer may, by  
| written notice to the other party, require disputes regarding the  
| amount owed under this section to be subject to nonbinding  
| arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American  
| Arbitration Association.

| agreement for the district by mutual consent. [ ~~The governing body~~  
|  ~~of a municipality, on written request from a district included in~~  
|  ~~the municipality's annexation plan under Section 43.052, shall~~

| municipality without the need for further action by the governing  
| body of the municipality. The full-purpose annexation conversion  
| date established by a strategic partnership agreement may be  
| altered only by mutual agreement of the district and the  
| municipality. However, nothing herein shall prevent the  
| municipality from terminating the agreement and instituting  
| proceedings to annex the district, on request by the governing body  
| of the district, on any date prior to the full-purpose annexation

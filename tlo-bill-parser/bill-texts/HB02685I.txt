|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to workers' compensation death benefit eligibility for  
| certain spouses of first responders and certain other public  
| servants killed in the line of duty.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 408.183(b-1), Labor Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (b), an eligible spouse  
| who remarried is eligible for death benefits for life if the  
| employee was a first responder, as defined by Section 504.055, _or an_  
| _individual described by Section 501.001(5)(F),_ who suffered death  
| in the course and scope of employment or while providing services as  
| a volunteer.  This subsection applies regardless of the date on  
| which the death of the first responder _or other individual_  
| occurred.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 408.183(b-1), Labor Code, applies only to an eligible spouse who  
| remarries on or after the effective date of this Act. An eligible  
| spouse who remarried before that date is governed by the law as it  
| existed immediately before the effective date of this Act, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  ~~transfer to the district providing education services an amount~~  
|  ~~equal to the difference between the average Foundation School~~  
|  ~~Program costs per student of the district providing education~~

| adjustment necessary. The following fiscal year _,_ [ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] a district's or school's entitlement under this  
| section is increased by an amount equal to the adjustment made under  
| this subsection[ ~~; and~~

|  SECTION 1.26. Sections 42.2531(a), (b), and (c), Education  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:

| commissioner to have the district's taxable value of property or ad  
| valorem tax collections adjusted for purposes of this chapter or  
| Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46. The commissioner may make the adjustment only  
| to the extent the commissioner determines that making the  
| adjustment will not:

| cause the amount to which school districts are entitled under this  
| chapter to exceed the amount appropriated for purposes of the  
| Foundation School Program for that year; and  
|  (2) if the adjustment is made in the first year of a  
| state fiscal biennium, cause the amount to which school districts  
| are entitled under this chapter for the second year of the biennium  
| to exceed the amount appropriated for purposes of the Foundation  
| School Program for that year.  
|  (c) The commissioner shall recover the benefit of any  
| adjustment made under this section by making offsetting adjustments  
| in the school district's taxable value of property or ad valorem tax  
| collections for purposes of this chapter or Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46 on a  
| final determination of the taxable value of property that was the  
| basis of the original adjustment, or in the second school year  
| following the year in which the adjustment is made, whichever is  
| earlier.  
|  SECTION 1.27. Section 42.257(b), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) If the district would have received a greater amount  
| from the foundation school fund for the applicable school year

| school fund. [ ~~An adjustment does not affect the local fund~~  
|  ~~assignment of any other district.~~ ]  
|  SECTION 1.28. Section 42.258(a-1), Education Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the agency may  
| recover an overallocation of state funds over a period not to exceed

| that the overallocation was the result of exceptional circumstances  
| reasonably caused by statutory changes to _former_ Chapter 41 _,_  
| _Chapter_ [ ~~or~~ ] 46 _,_ or this chapter and related reporting  
| requirements.  
|  SECTION 1.29. Section 42.259(a)(4), Education Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (4) "Wealth per student" means the taxable property  
| values reported by the comptroller _under Section 5.09, Tax Code,_  
| [ ~~to the commissioner under Section 42.252~~ ] divided by the number of  
| students in average daily attendance.

| district or participating charter school is entitled due to the  
| increases in formula funding made by H.B. No. 3343, Acts of the 77th  
| Legislature, Regular Session, 2001, and any subsequent legislation

|  SECTION 1.31. Sections 42.302(a), (a-1), (a-2), (b), and  
| (d), Education Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount  
| per weighted student in state and local funds for each cent of tax  
| effort [ ~~over that required for the district's local fund~~  
|  ~~assignment~~ ] up to the maximum level specified in this subchapter.  
| The amount of state support, subject only to the maximum amount  
| under Section 42.303, is determined by the formula:  
| GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR  
| where:  
|  "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be  
| allocated to the district;  
|  "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local  
| funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is an  
| amount described by Subsection (a-1) or a greater amount for any  
| year provided by appropriation;  
|  "WADA" is the number of students in weighted average daily  
| attendance, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the school  
| district's allotments under Subchapters B and C, less any allotment  
| to the district for transportation, any allotment under Section  
| 42.158 or 42.160, and 50 percent of the adjustment under Section  
| 42.102, by the basic allotment for the applicable year;  
|  "DTR" is the district enrichment tax rate of the school  
| district, which is determined by subtracting the amounts specified  
| by Subsection (b) from the total amount of _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance~~  
|  ~~and operations~~ ] taxes collected by the school district for the  
| applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient  
| of the district's taxable value of property as determined under  
| Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable,  
| under Section 42.2521, divided by 100; and  
|  "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying  
| "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section 42.2521, divided by 100.  
|  (a-1) For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount  
| guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per  
| cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:  
|  (1) the greater of the amount of district tax revenue  
| per weighted student per cent of tax effort that would be available  
| to the Austin Independent School District, as determined by the  
| commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative Budget Board, if  
| the reduction of the limitation on tax increases as provided by  
| Section 11.26(a-1), (a-2), or (a-3), Tax Code, did not apply, or the  
| amount of district tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax  
| effort used for purposes of this subdivision in the preceding  
| school year, for the first six cents _of_ [ ~~by which~~ ] the district's  
| _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance and operations~~ ] tax rate [ ~~exceeds the
rate~~  
|  ~~equal to the sum of the product of the state compression percentage,~~  
|  ~~as determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance~~  
|  ~~and operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax~~  
|  ~~year and any additional tax effort included in calculating the~~  
|  ~~district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1)~~ ]; and  
|  (2) $31.95, for the district's _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance~~  
|  ~~and operations~~ ] tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort  
| described by Subdivision (1).  
|  (a-2) The limitation on district enrichment tax rate  
| ("DTR") under Section 42.303 does not apply to the district's  
| [ ~~maintenance and operations~~ ] tax effort described by Subsection  
| (a-1)(1).  
|  (b) In computing the district enrichment tax rate of a  
| school district, the total amount of _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations~~ ] taxes collected by the school district does not include  
| the amount of[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the district's local fund assignment under~~  
|  ~~Section 42.252; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ] taxes paid into a tax increment fund under  
| Chapter 311, Tax Code.  
|  (d) For purposes of this section, the total amount of  
| _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance and operations~~ ] taxes collected for an  
| applicable school year by a school district with alternate tax  
| dates, as authorized by Section 26.135, Tax Code, is the amount of  
| _enrichment_ taxes collected on or after January 1 of the year in  
| which the school year begins and not later than December 31 of the  
| same year.

|  ~~maximum rate permitted under Section 45.003 exceeds the rate used~~  
|  ~~to determine the district's local share under Section 42.252, or a~~  
|  ~~greater amount for any year provided by appropriation~~ ].  
|  SECTION 1.33. Section 44.004, Education Code, is amended by

| appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit, shall adopt a tax  
| rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the  
| unit of the rate adopted. The tax rate consists of two components,  
| each of which must be approved separately. The components are:  
|  (1) for a taxing unit other than a school district, the  
| rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the  
| total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C), less any  
| amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to  
| pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated

| until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and  
| the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order,  
| depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by  
| the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or  
| order setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting  
| the budget. For a taxing unit other than a school district, the  
| vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that  
| exceeds the effective tax rate must be a record vote, and at least  
| 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor  
| of the ordinance, resolution, or order. For a school district, the  
| vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that  
| exceeds the sum of the effective _enrichment_ [ ~~maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations tax~~ ] rate of the district [ ~~as determined under Section~~  
|  ~~26.08(i)~~ ] and the district's current debt rate must be a record  
| vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body  
| must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order. A  
| motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax  
| rate that exceeds the effective tax rate must be made in the  
| following form: "I move that the property tax rate be increased by  
| the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax rate), which is

| exceeds the effective tax rate) percent increase in the tax  
| rate."  
|  _(b-1)_ If the ordinance, resolution, or order _adopted by a_  
| _governing body under Subsection (b)_ sets a tax rate that, if applied  
| to the total taxable value, will impose an amount of taxes to fund  
| _the_ maintenance and operation expenditures _or, in the case of a_  
| _school district, the enrichment expenditures_ of the taxing unit  
| that exceeds the amount of taxes imposed for that purpose in the  
| preceding year, the taxing unit must:  
|  (1) include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in  
| type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:  
|  (A) the following statement: "THIS TAX RATE  
| WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR _(Insert_ MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS _or_  
| _ENRICHMENT, as applicable)_ THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE."; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the effective  
| maintenance and operations rate _or the effective enrichment rate,_  
| _as applicable_ , the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL  
| EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE  
| EXCEEDS THE EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE _OR EFFECTIVE_  
| _ENRICHMENT RATE, AS APPLICABLE_ ) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES [ ~~FOR~~  
|  ~~MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS~~ ] ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY  
| $(Insert amount)."; and  
|  (2) include on the home page of any Internet website  
| operated by the unit:  
|  (A) the following statement: "(Insert name of  
| unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR _(Insert_  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS _or ENRICHMENT, as applicable)_ THAN LAST  
| YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the effective  
| maintenance and operations rate _or the effective enrichment rate,_  
| _as applicable_ , the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL  
| EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE  
| EXCEEDS THE EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE _OR EFFECTIVE_  
| _ENRICHMENT RATE, AS APPLICABLE_ ) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES [ ~~FOR~~  
|  ~~MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS~~ ] ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY  
| $(Insert amount)."  
|  (g) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a  
| school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption  
| of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year  
| may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the  
| certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief  
| appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district  
| participates has certified to the assessor for the school district  
| an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district  
| as provided by Section 26.01(e). If a school district adopts a tax  
| rate under this subsection, the effective tax rate [ ~~and the~~

| _issuance of permits under this section for the completion and_  
| _operation of a well for the withdrawal of brackish groundwater from_  
| _a designated brackish groundwater production zone and shall adopt_  
| _rules described by this subsection if the district receives a_  
| _petition from a person with a legally defined interest in_  
| _groundwater in the district. The district must adopt the rules not_

| _groundwater to water quality standards sufficient for the project_  
| _needs._  
|  _(d) The rules adopted must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____provide for processing an application for a_  
| _brackish groundwater production zone operating permit in the same_  
| _manner as an application for an operating permit for a fresh_  
| _groundwater well, except as provided by this section;_  
|  _(2)_ _____allow withdrawals and rates of withdrawal of_  
| _brackish groundwater from a designated brackish groundwater_  
| _production zone not to exceed and consistent with the withdrawal_

|  _(3)_ _____provide for a minimum term of 30 years for a permit_  
| _issued for a well that produces brackish groundwater from a_  
| _designated brackish groundwater production zone;_  
|  _(4)_ _____require implementation of a monitoring system_  
| _recommended by the development board to monitor water levels and_  
| _water quality in the same or an adjacent aquifer, subdivision of an_  
| _aquifer, or geologic stratum in which the designated brackish_  
| _groundwater production zone is located;_  
|  _(5)_ _____for a project located in a designated brackish_  
| _groundwater production zone in the Gulf Coast Aquifer, require_  
| _reasonable monitoring by the district of land elevations to_  
| _determine if production from the project is causing or is likely to_  
| _cause subsidence during the permit term;_  
|  _(6)_ _____require from the holder of a permit issued under_  
| _rules adopted under this section annual reports that must include:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the amount of brackish groundwater_  
| _withdrawn;_  
|  _(B)_ _____the average monthly water quality of the_  
| _brackish groundwater withdrawn and in the monitoring wells; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____aquifer levels in both the designated_  
| _brackish groundwater production zone and in any aquifer,_  
| _subdivision of an aquifer, or geologic stratum for which the permit_  
| _requires monitoring;_  
|  _(7)_ _____provide greater access to brackish groundwater by_  
| _simplifying procedure, avoiding delay in permitting, saving_  
| _expense for the permit seeker, and providing flexibility to permit_  
| _applicants and the district;_  
|  _(8)_ _____be consistent with and not impair property rights_  
| _described by Sections 36.002(a) and (b); and_  
|  _(9)_ _____specify all additional information that must be_  
| _included in an application._  
|  _(e)_ _____Additional information required under Subsection (d)(9)_  
| _must be reasonably related to an issue the district is authorized to_  
| _consider._  
|  _(f)_ _____An application for a brackish groundwater production_  
| _zone operating permit must include:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the proposed well field design compared to the_  
| _designated brackish groundwater production zone;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the requested maximum groundwater withdrawal rate_  
| _for the proposed project;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the number and location of monitoring wells needed_  
| _to determine the effects of the proposed project on water levels and_  
| _water quality in the same or an adjacent aquifer, subdivision of an_  
| _aquifer, or geologic stratum in which the designated brackish_  
| _groundwater production zone is located; and_  
|  _(4) a report that includes:_  
|  _(A)_ _____a simulation of the projected effects of the_  
| _proposed production on water levels and water quality in the same or_  
| _an adjacent aquifer, subdivision of an aquifer, or geologic stratum_  
| _in which the designated brackish groundwater production zone is_  
| _located;_  
|  _(B)_ _____a description of the model used for the_

|  _(h)_ _____The district may not schedule a hearing on the_  
| _application until the district receives the report from the_  
| _development board described by Subsection (g)._  
|  _(i)_ _____The district shall provide the reports required under_  
| _Subsection (d)(6) to the development board. Not later than the_  
| _120th day after the date the development board receives a request_  
| _from the district, the development board shall investigate and_  
| _issue a report on whether brackish groundwater production under the_  
| _project that is the subject of the report from the designated_  
| _brackish groundwater production zone is projected to cause:_  
|  _(1)_ _____significant aquifer level declines in the same or_  
| _an adjacent aquifer, subdivision of an aquifer, or geologic stratum_  
| _that were not anticipated by the development board in the_  
| _designation of the zone;_  
|  _(2)_ _____negative effects on quality of water in an_  
| _aquifer, subdivision of an aquifer, or geologic stratum; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____for a project located in a designated brackish_  
| _groundwater production zone in the Gulf Coast Aquifer, subsidence_  
| _during the permit term._  
|  _(j)_ _____After receiving from the development board a report_  
| _issued under Subsection (i) and after notice and hearing subject to_  
| _Subchapter M, the district may:_  
|  _(1)_ _____amend the applicable permit to establish a_  
| _production limit necessary to mitigate any negative effects_  
| _identified by the report;_  
|  _(2)_ _____approve a mitigation plan that alleviates any_  
| _negative effects identified by the report; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____both amend the permit to establish a production_  
| _limit and approve a mitigation plan._  
|  _(k)_ _____Rules adopted under this section must provide that the_  
| _production authorized from a designated brackish groundwater_  
| _production zone is in addition to the amount of managed available_  
| _groundwater provided under Section 36.108. To the extent possible,_  
| _a district shall issue permits up to the point that the total volume_  
| _of exempt and permitted groundwater production in a designated_  
| _brackish groundwater production zone equals the amount of brackish_  
| _groundwater that may be produced annually to achieve the_  
| _groundwater availability described by the development board in its_  
| _designation of the brackish groundwater production zone under_  
| _Section 16.060(e)._  
|  _(l)_ _____A district may not adopt rules limiting access to the_  
| _production of groundwater within a designated brackish groundwater_  
| _production zone to only those projects described by Subsection(c)._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

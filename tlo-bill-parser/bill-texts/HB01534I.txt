|  AN ACT  
| relating to the selection of the board of directors of an appraisal  
| district; authorizing the imposition of a fee.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 5.12(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) At the written request of the governing bodies of a  
| majority of _all_ the taxing units participating in an appraisal  
| district or of a majority of the _group of_ taxing units _composed of_  
| _the municipalities, school districts, junior college districts,_  
| _and county participating in the appraisal district_ [ ~~entitled to~~  
|  ~~vote on the appointment of appraisal district directors~~ ], the  
| comptroller shall audit the performance of the appraisal district.  
| The governing bodies may request a general audit of the performance  
| of the appraisal district or may request an audit of only one or  
| more particular duties, practices, functions, departments, or  
| other appraisal district matters.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 5.13(h), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (h) At any time after the request for an audit is made, the  
| comptroller may discontinue the audit in whole or in part if  
| requested to do so by:  
|  (1) the governing bodies of a majority of _all_ the  
| taxing units participating in the district, if the audit was  
| requested by a majority of those units;  
|  (2) the governing bodies of a majority of the _group of_  
| taxing units _composed of the municipalities, school districts,_  
| _junior college districts, and county participating in the appraisal_  
| _district_ [ ~~entitled to vote on the appointment of appraisal district~~  
|  ~~directors~~ ], if the audit was requested by a majority of those units;  
| or  
|  (3) _the taxpayers who requested the audit,_ if the  
| audit was requested under Section 5.12(c) [ ~~of this code, by the~~  
|  ~~taxpayers who requested the audit~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Section 6.03, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a) and (l) and adding Subsections (a-1) and (m) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) The appraisal district is governed by a board of _five_  
| directors. _One director is elected from each of the four_  
| _commissioners precincts of the county for which the appraisal_  
| _district is established. The county assessor-collector is a_  
| _director by virtue of the person's office. The directors other than_  
| _the county assessor-collector are elected at the general election_  
| _for state and county officers and serve two-year terms beginning on_  
| _January 1 of odd-numbered years._ [ ~~Five directors are appointed by~~  
|  ~~the taxing units that participate in the district as provided by~~  
|  ~~this section. If the county assessor-collector is not appointed to~~  
|  ~~the board, the county assessor-collector serves as a nonvoting~~  
|  ~~director.~~ ] The county assessor-collector is ineligible to serve if  
| the board enters into a contract under Section 6.05(b) or if the  
| commissioners court of the county enters into a contract under  
| Section 6.24(b). _If the county assessor-collector is ineligible to_  
| _serve, the appraisal district is governed by the four directors_  
| _elected from the commissioners precincts and a director elected_  
| _from the county at large. The director elected from the county at_  
| _large is elected at the same election and serves the same term of_  
| _office as the four directors elected from the commissioners_  
| _precincts._  
|  _(a-1)_ To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an  
| individual other than _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] county assessor-collector [ ~~serving
as~~  
|  ~~a nonvoting director~~ ] must _:_  
|  _(1)_ be a resident of _:_  
|  _(A)_ the _commissioners precinct from which the_  
| _office is elected, in the case of a director elected from a_  
| _commissioners precinct; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____the county for which the appraisal district_  
| _is established, in the case of a director elected from the county at_  
| _large;_ [ ~~district~~ ] and  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~must~~ ] have resided in the _appraisal_ district for  
| at least two years immediately preceding the date the individual  
| takes office. [ ~~An individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on~~  
|  ~~the board is not ineligible because of membership on the governing~~  
|  ~~body of a taxing unit. An employee of a taxing unit that~~  
|  ~~participates in the district is not eligible to serve on the board~~  
|  ~~unless the individual is also a member of the governing body or an~~  
|  ~~elected official of a taxing unit that participates in the~~  
|  ~~district.~~ ]  
|  (l) _A_ [ ~~If a~~ ] vacancy [ ~~occurs~~ ] on the board of directors  
| other than a vacancy in the position held by _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] county  
| assessor-collector _is filled for the remainder of the unexpired_  
| _term by appointment by the commissioners court of the county for_  
| _which the appraisal district is established._ ___A person appointed to_  
| _fill a vacancy on the board of directors must meet the_  
| _qualifications of the vacated position_ [ ~~serving as a nonvoting~~  
|  ~~director, each taxing unit that is entitled to vote by this section~~  
|  ~~may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body a~~  
|  ~~candidate to fill the vacancy. The unit shall submit the name of~~  
|  ~~its nominee to the chief appraiser within 45 days after~~  
|  ~~notification from the board of directors of the existence of the~~  
|  ~~vacancy, and the chief appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the~~  
|  ~~board of directors within the next five days a list of the nominees.~~  
|  ~~The board of directors shall elect by majority vote of its members~~  
|  ~~one of the nominees to fill the vacancy~~ ].  
|  _(m)_ _____If as a result of a change in the boundaries of a_  
| _commissioners precinct an individual serving as a director no_  
| _longer resides in the precinct from which the office is elected, the_  
| _individual is not for that reason disqualified from office during_  
| _the remainder of the term of office being served at the time the_  
| _boundary change takes effect. If as a result of a change in the_  
| _boundaries of a commissioners precinct an individual elected as a_  
| _director before the boundary change to a term that begins after the_  
| _boundary change no longer resides in the precinct from which_  
| _elected, the individual is not for that reason disqualified from_  
| _serving the term to which elected._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 6.036(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) An individual is not eligible to be _a candidate for, to_  
| _be_ appointed to _,_ or to serve on the board of directors of an  
| appraisal district if the individual or a business entity in which  
| the individual has a substantial interest is a party to a contract  
| with:  
|  (1) the appraisal district; or  
|  (2) a taxing unit that participates in the appraisal  
| district, if the contract relates to the performance of an activity  
| governed by this title.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 6.051(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) The acquisition or conveyance of real property or the  
| construction or renovation of a building or other improvement by an  
| appraisal district must be approved by the governing bodies of  
| three-fourths of the _group of_ taxing units _composed of the_  
| _municipalities, school districts, junior college districts, and_  
| _county participating in the appraisal district_ [ ~~entitled to vote on~~  
|  ~~the appointment of board members~~ ]. The board of directors by  
| resolution may propose a property transaction or other action for  
| which this subsection requires approval of _those_ [ ~~the~~ ] taxing  
| units. The chief appraiser shall notify the presiding officer of  
| each governing body entitled to vote on the approval of the proposal  
| by delivering a copy of the board's resolution, together with  
| information showing the costs of other available alternatives to  
| the proposal. On or before the 30th day after the date the  
| presiding officer receives notice of the proposal, the governing  
| body of a taxing unit by resolution may approve or disapprove the  
| proposal. If a governing body fails to act on or before that 30th  
| day or fails to file its resolution with the chief appraiser on or  
| before the 10th day after that 30th day, the proposal is treated as  
| if it were disapproved by the governing body.  
|  SECTION 6. Sections 6.06(a), (b), and (i), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Each year the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed  
| budget for the operations of the district for the following tax year  
| and shall submit copies to each taxing unit participating in the  
| district and to the district board of directors before June 15. _The_  
| _chief appraiser_ [ ~~He~~ ] shall include in the budget a list showing each  
| proposed position, the proposed salary for the position, all  
| benefits proposed for the position, each proposed capital  
| expenditure, and an estimate of the amount of the budget that will  
| be allocated to each taxing unit. Each _municipality, each school_  
| _district, each junior college district, and the county_  
| _participating in the appraisal district_ [ ~~taxing unit entitled to~~  
|  ~~vote on the appointment of board members~~ ] shall maintain a copy of  
| the proposed budget for public inspection at its principal  
| administrative office.  
|  (b) The board of directors shall hold a public hearing to  
| consider the budget. The secretary of the board shall deliver to  
| the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit  
| participating in the district not later than the 10th day before the  
| date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and place  
| fixed for the hearing.  The board shall complete its hearings, make  
| any amendments to the proposed budget it desires, and finally  
| approve a budget before September 15. If governing bodies of a  
| majority of the _group of taxing units composed of the_  
| _municipalities, school districts, junior college districts, and_  
| _county participating in the appraisal district_ [ ~~taxing units~~  
|  ~~entitled to vote on the appointment of board members~~ ] adopt  
| resolutions disapproving a budget and file them with the secretary  
| of the board within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not  
| take effect, and the board shall adopt a new budget within 30 days  
| of the disapproval.  
|  (i) The fiscal year of an appraisal district is the calendar  
| year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the _group of_  
| _taxing units composed of the municipalities, school districts,_  
| _junior college districts, and county participating in the appraisal_  
| _district_ [ ~~taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board~~  
|  ~~members~~ ] adopt resolutions proposing a different fiscal year and  
| file them with the secretary of the board not more than 12 and not  
| less than eight months before the first day of the fiscal year  
| proposed by the resolutions. If the fiscal year of an appraisal  
| district is changed under this subsection, the chief appraiser  
| shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year as provided by  
| Subsection (a) [ ~~of this section~~ ] before the 15th day of the seventh  
| month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the  
| change, and the board of directors shall adopt a budget for the  
| fiscal year as provided by Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ] before  
| the 15th day of the fourth month preceding the first day of the  
| fiscal year established by the change. Unless the appraisal  
| district adopts a different method of allocation under Section  
| 6.061 [ ~~of this code~~ ], the allocation of the budget to each taxing  
| unit shall be calculated as provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ] using the amount of property taxes imposed by each  
| participating taxing unit in the most recent tax year preceding the  
| fiscal year established by the change for which the necessary  
| information is available. Each taxing unit shall pay its  
| allocation as provided by Subsection (e) [ ~~of this section~~ ], except  
| that the first payment shall be made before the first day of the  
| fiscal year established by the change and subsequent payments shall  
| be made quarterly. In the year in which a change in the fiscal year  
| occurs, the budget that takes effect on January 1 of that year may  
| be amended as necessary as provided by Subsection (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ] in order to accomplish the change in fiscal years.  
|  SECTION 7. Sections 6.061(b) and (e), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) The taxing units participating in an appraisal district  
| may adopt a different method of allocating the costs of operating  
| the district if the governing bodies of three-fourths of the _group_  
| _of taxing units composed of the municipalities, school districts,_  
| _junior college districts, and county participating in the appraisal_  
| _district_ [ ~~taxing units that are entitled to vote on the appointment~~  
|  ~~of board members~~ ] adopt resolutions providing for the other method.  
| However, a change under this subsection is not valid if it requires  
| any taxing unit to pay a greater proportion of the appraisal  
| district's costs than the unit would pay under Section 6.06 [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~code~~ ] without the consent of the governing body of that unit.  
|  (e) A change in allocation of district costs made as  
| provided by this section remains in effect until changed in a manner  
| provided by this section or rescinded by resolution of a majority of  
| the governing bodies _of the group of taxing units composed of the_  
| _municipalities, school districts, junior college districts, and_  
| _county participating in the appraisal district_ [ ~~that are entitled~~  
|  ~~to vote on appointment of board members under Section 6.03 of this~~  
|  ~~code~~ ].  
|  SECTION 8. Section 6.063(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) The report of the audit is a public record. A copy of  
| the report shall be delivered to the presiding officer of the  
| governing body of each _municipality, each school district, each_  
| _junior college district, and the county participating in the_  
| _appraisal district_ [ ~~taxing unit eligible to vote on the appointment~~  
|  ~~of district directors~~ ], and a reasonable number of copies shall be  
| available for inspection at the appraisal office.  
|  SECTION 9. Section 6.15(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to a routine  
| communication between the chief appraiser and the county  
| assessor-collector that relates to the administration of an  
| appraisal roll, including a communication made in connection with  
| the certification, correction, or collection of an account,  
| regardless of whether the county assessor-collector _serves on_ [ ~~was~~  
|  ~~appointed to~~ ] the board of directors of the appraisal district [
~~or~~  
|  ~~serves as a nonvoting director~~ ].

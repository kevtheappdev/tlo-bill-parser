|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the relationship between the amount of an  
| administrative penalty imposed by the Texas Commission on  
| Environmental Quality and the economic benefit of the violation to  
| the alleged violator.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 7.053, Water Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 7.053. FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINATION OF  
| PENALTY AMOUNT.  _(a)_ In determining the amount of an administrative  
| penalty, the commission shall consider:  
|  (1) the nature, circumstances, extent, duration, and  
| gravity of the prohibited act, with special emphasis on the  
| impairment of existing water rights or the hazard or potential  
| hazard created to the health or safety of the public;  
|  (2) the impact of the violation on:  
|  (A) air quality in the region;  
|  (B) a receiving stream or underground water  
| reservoir;  
|  (C) instream uses, water quality, aquatic and  
| wildlife habitat, or beneficial freshwater inflows to bays and  
| estuaries; or  
|  (D) affected persons;  
|  (3) with respect to the alleged violator:  
|  (A) the history and extent of previous  
| violations;  
|  (B) the degree of culpability, including whether  
| the violation was attributable to mechanical or electrical failures  
| and whether the violation could have been reasonably anticipated  
| and avoided;  
|  (C) the demonstrated good faith, including  
| actions taken by the alleged violator to rectify the cause of the  
| violation and to compensate affected persons;  
|  (D) _the_ economic benefit gained through the  
| violation; and  
|  (E) the amount necessary to deter future  
| violations; and  
|  (4) any other matters that justice may require.  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as otherwise provided by Subsections (c) and (d)_  
| _and notwithstanding Subsection (a), in determining the amount of an_  
| _administrative penalty, the commission shall, to the extent_  
| _practicable, ensure that the amount of the penalty is at least equal_  
| _to the value of any economic benefit gained by the alleged violator_  
| _through the violation._  
|  _(c)_ _____In determining the economic benefit of noncompliance,_  
| _the commission shall provide the alleged violator, on the_  
| _violator's request, an opportunity to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____review the information on which the economic_  
| _benefit calculation is based; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____demonstrate that the calculation does not reflect_  
| _the actual circumstances._  
|  _(d)_ _____A determination under Subsection (b) may not result in_  
| _the imposition of an administrative penalty in an amount that_  
| _exceeds a limitation on the amount of the penalty provided by_  
| _statute, including the maximum amount provided by Section 7.052._  
|  _(e)_ _____The commission shall allow a governmental entity or_  
| _nonprofit organization to defer payment on any portion of the_  
| _penalty attributable to the consideration of economic benefit on_  
| _the condition that the entity or organization complies with the_  
| _schedule and terms of the enforcement order associated with the_  
| _violation for which the penalty is imposed._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 7.053(b), (c), (d), and (e), Water  
| Code, as added by this Act, apply only to a violation that occurs on  
| or after the effective date of this Act.  For purposes of this  
| section, a violation occurs before the effective date of this Act if  
| any element of the violation occurs before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

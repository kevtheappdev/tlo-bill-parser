|  SECTION 38. Section 53.255(b), Property Code, is amended to

| similar to the following:  
|  "KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW. You  
| are about to enter into a transaction to build a new home or remodel  
| existing residential property. Texas law requires your contractor  
| to provide you with this brief overview of some of your rights,  
| responsibilities, and risks in this transaction.  
|  "CONVEYANCE TO CONTRACTOR NOT REQUIRED. Your contractor may  
| not require you to convey your real property to your contractor as a  
| condition to the agreement for the construction of improvements on  
| your property.  
|  "KNOW YOUR CONTRACTOR. Before you enter into your agreement  
| for the construction of improvements to your real property, make  
| sure that you have investigated your contractor. Obtain and verify  
| references from other people who have used the contractor for the  
| type and size of construction project on your property.  
|  "GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure that you have a written  
| agreement with your contractor that includes: (1) a description of  
| the work the contractor is to perform; (2) the required or  
| estimated time for completion of the work; (3) the cost of the work  
| or how the cost will be determined; and (4) the procedure and  
| method of payment, including [ ~~provisions for statutory retainage~~  
|  ~~and~~ ] conditions for final payment. If your contractor made a  
| promise, warranty, or representation to you concerning the work the  
| contractor is to perform, make sure that promise, warranty, or  
| representation is specified in the written agreement. An oral  
| promise that is not included in the written agreement may not be  
| enforceable under Texas law.  
|  "READ BEFORE YOU SIGN. Do not sign any document before you  
| have read and understood it. NEVER SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDES AN  
| UNTRUE STATEMENT. Take your time in reviewing documents. If you  
| borrow money from a lender to pay for the improvements, you are  
| entitled to have the loan closing documents furnished to you for  
| review at least one business day before the closing. Do not waive  
| this requirement unless a bona fide emergency or another good cause  
| exists, and make sure you understand the documents before you sign  
| them. If you fail to comply with the terms of the documents, you  
| could lose your property. You are entitled to have your own  
| attorney review any documents. If you have any question about the  
| meaning of a document, consult an attorney.  
|  "GET A LIST OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Before  
| construction commences, your contractor is required to provide you  
| with a list of the subcontractors and suppliers the contractor  
| intends to use on your project. Your contractor is required to  
| supply updated information on any subcontractors and suppliers  
| added after the list is provided. Your contractor is not required  
| to supply this information if you sign a written waiver of your  
| rights to receive this information.  
|  "MONITOR THE WORK. Lenders and governmental authorities may  
| inspect the work in progress from time to time for their own  
| purposes. These inspections are not intended as quality control  
| inspections. Quality control is a matter for you and your  
| contractor. To ensure that your home is being constructed in  
| accordance with your wishes and specifications, you should inspect  
| the work yourself or have your own independent inspector review the  
| work in progress.  
|  "MONITOR PAYMENTS. If you use a lender, your lender is  
| required to provide you with a periodic statement showing the money  
| disbursed by the lender from the proceeds of your loan. Each time  
| your contractor requests payment from you or your lender for work  
| performed, your contractor is also required to furnish you with a  
| disbursement statement that lists the name and address of each  
| subcontractor or supplier that the contractor intends to pay from  
| the requested funds. Review these statements and make sure that the  
| money is being properly disbursed.  
|  "CLAIMS BY SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Under Texas law, if  
| a subcontractor or supplier who furnishes labor or materials for  
| the construction of improvements on your property is not paid, you  
| may _be_ [ ~~become~~ ] liable and your property may be subject to a lien  
| for the unpaid amount, even if you have not contracted directly with  
| the subcontractor or supplier. To _minimize your_ [ ~~avoid~~ ] liability,  
| you should take the following actions:  
|  (1) If you receive a written notice from a  
| subcontractor or supplier, you should withhold payment from your  
| contractor for the amount of the claim stated in the notice until  
| the dispute between your contractor and the subcontractor or  
| supplier is resolved.  
|  _(2)_ If your lender is disbursing money directly to  
| your contractor, you should immediately provide a copy of the  
| notice to your lender and instruct the lender to withhold payment in  
| the amount of the claim stated in the notice. If you continue to pay  
| the contractor after receiving the written notice without  
| withholding the amount of the claim, you may be liable and your  
| property may be subject to a lien for the amount you failed to  
| withhold.  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~During construction and for 30 days after final~~  
|  ~~completion, termination, or abandonment of the contract by the~~  
|  ~~contractor, you should withhold or cause your lender to withhold 10~~  
|  ~~percent of the amount of payments made for the work performed by~~  
|  ~~your contractor. This is sometimes referred to as "statutory~~  
|  ~~retainage.' If you choose not to withhold the 10 percent for at~~  
|  ~~least 30 days after final completion, termination, or abandonment~~  
|  ~~of the contract by the contractor and if a valid claim is timely~~  
|  ~~made by a claimant and your contractor fails to pay the claim, you~~  
|  ~~may be personally liable and your property may be subject to a lien~~  
|  ~~up to the amount that you failed to withhold.~~ ]  
|  "If a claim is not paid within a certain time period, the  
| claimant is required to file a [ ~~mechanic's~~ ] lien _claim_ affidavit in  
| the real property records in the county where the property is  
| located. A [ ~~mechanic's~~ ] lien _claim_ affidavit is not a lien on your  
| property, but the filing of the affidavit could result in a court  
| imposing a lien on your property if the claimant is successful in  
| litigation to enforce the lien claim.  
|  "SOME CLAIMS MAY NOT BE VALID. When you receive a written  
| notice of _unpaid balance_ [ ~~a claim~~ ] or when a [ ~~mechanic's~~ ] lien
_claim_  
| affidavit is filed on your property, you should know your legal  
| rights and responsibilities regarding the claim. Not all claims are  
| valid. [ ~~A notice of a claim by a subcontractor or supplier is~~  
|  ~~required to be sent, and the mechanic's lien affidavit is required~~  
|  ~~to be filed, within strict time periods. The notice and the~~  
|  ~~affidavit must contain certain information.~~ ] All claimants may not  
| fully comply with the legal requirements to collect on a claim. _If_  
| _your property is a homestead and you did not enter into a written_  
| _contract with your contractor that complies with the statutory_  
| _requirements for a lien on a homestead, your contractor, the_  
| _subcontractor, or the supplier may not claim a valid lien on your_  
| _property._ [ ~~If you have paid the contractor in full before receiving~~  
|  ~~a notice of a claim and have fully complied with the law regarding~~  
|  ~~statutory retainage, you may not be liable for that claim.~~ ]  
| Accordingly, you should consult your attorney when you receive a  
| written notice of a claim to determine the true extent of your  
| liability or potential liability for that claim.  
|  "OBTAIN A LIEN RELEASE AND A BILLS-PAID AFFIDAVIT. When you  
| receive a notice of _unpaid balance or a notice of a filed lien claim_  
| _affidavit_ [ ~~claim~~ ], do not release withheld funds without obtaining  
| a signed and notarized release of lien and claim from the claimant.  
| You can [ ~~also~~ ] reduce the risk of having a claim filed by a  
| subcontractor or supplier by requiring as a condition of each  
| payment made by you or your lender that your contractor furnish you  
| with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. Under  
| Texas law, on final completion of the work and before final payment,  
| the contractor is required to furnish you with an affidavit stating  
| that all bills have been paid. If the contractor discloses any  
| unpaid bill in the affidavit, you should withhold payment in the  
| amount of the unpaid bill until you receive a waiver of lien or  
| release from that subcontractor or supplier.  
|  "OBTAIN TITLE INSURANCE PROTECTION. You may be able to obtain  
| a title insurance policy to insure that the title to your property  
| and the existing improvements on your property are free from liens  
| claimed by subcontractors and suppliers. If your policy is issued  
| before the improvements are completed and covers the value of the  
| improvements to be completed, you should obtain, on the completion  
| of the improvements and as a condition of your final payment,  
| a 'completion of improvements' policy endorsement. This  
| endorsement will protect your property from liens claimed by  
| subcontractors and suppliers that may arise from the date the  
| original title policy is issued to the date of the endorsement."  
|  SECTION 39. Sections 53.259(a) and (c), Property Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) As a condition of final payment under a residential  
| construction contract, the original contractor shall, at the time  
| the final payment is tendered, execute and deliver to the owner, or  
| the owner's agent, an affidavit _acknowledging the amount claimed_  
| _for payment and_ stating that the original contractor has paid each  
| person in full for all labor and materials used in the construction  
| of improvements on the real property. If the original contractor  
| has not paid each person in full, the original contractor shall  
| state in the affidavit the amount owed and the name and, if known,  
| the address and telephone number of each person to whom a payment is  
| owed.  
|  (c) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally,  
| knowingly, or recklessly makes a false or misleading statement in  
| an affidavit under this section. An offense under this section is a  
| misdemeanor. A person adjudged guilty of an offense under this  
| section shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $4,000 or  
| confinement in jail for a term not to exceed one year or both a fine  
| and confinement. [ ~~A person may not receive community supervision~~  
|  ~~for the offense.~~ ]  
|  SECTION 40. Section 53.281, Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 53.281. WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIEN OR PAYMENT BOND  
| CLAIM.  (a)  _Except as provided by Section 53.287, any_ [ ~~Any~~ ] waiver  
| and release of a lien or payment bond claim under this chapter is  
| unenforceable unless a waiver and release is executed and delivered  
| in accordance with this subchapter.  
|  (b) A waiver and release is effective to release the owner,  
| the owner's property, the contractor, and the surety on a payment  
| bond from claims and liens only if:  
|  (1) the waiver and release substantially complies with  
| one of the forms prescribed by Section 53.284;  
|  (2) the waiver and release is signed by the claimant or  
| the claimant's authorized agent and _acknowledged_ [ ~~notarized~~ ]; and  
|  (3) in the case of a conditional release, evidence of  
| payment to the claimant exists.  
|  _(c)_ _____A waiver and release that substantially complies with a_  
| _form required by Section 53.284 may be combined with a bills-paid_  
| _affidavit that substantially conforms to the requirements of_  
| _Section 53.085 or 53.259._  
|  SECTION 41. Section 53.282(b), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) The filing of a lien rendered unenforceable by a lien  
| waiver under Subsection (a)(3) does not violate Section 12.002,  
| Civil Practice and Remedies Code, unless:  
|  (1) an owner or original contractor sends a written  
| explanation of the basis for nonpayment, evidence of the  
| contractual waiver of lien rights, and a notice of request for  
| release of the lien to the claimant at the claimant's address stated  
| in the lien _claim_ affidavit; and  
|  (2) the lien claimant does not release the filed lien  
| _claim_ affidavit on or before the 14th day after the date the owner  
| or the original contractor sends the items required by Subdivision  
| (1).  
|  SECTION 42. Section 53.283, Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 53.283. UNCONDITIONAL WAIVER AND RELEASE: PAYMENT  
| REQUIRED.  _(a)_ A person may not require a claimant or potential  
| claimant to execute an unconditional waiver and release for a  
| progress payment or final payment amount unless the claimant or  
| potential claimant received payment in that amount in good and  
| sufficient funds.  
|  _(b)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a contractual_  
| _requirement for a claimant to waive or release the claimant's lien_  
| _rights under this chapter before performance of the work for which_  
| _the claim for payment is asserted is void._  
|  _(c)_ _____A claimant may tender an unconditional waiver and_  
| _release for payment before the actual receipt of a payment to be_  
| _delivered in trust to an attorney, title insurance company, title_  
| _insurance agent, or federally insured financial institution acting_  
| _as an escrow agent._ ___The escrow agent may deliver the waiver and_  
| _release only after the claimant has confirmed receipt of payment in_  
| _good and sufficient funds._  
|  SECTION 43. Section 53.284, Property Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) and adding Subsection  
| (f) to read as follows:  
|  (b) If a claimant or potential claimant is required to  
| execute a waiver and release in exchange for or to induce the  
| payment of a progress payment and is not paid in exchange for the  
| waiver and release or if a single payee check or joint payee check  
| is given in exchange for the waiver and release, the waiver and  
| release must read:

| for record, _and_ the amount paid by the purchaser as taxes,  
| penalties, interest, and costs on the property, plus a redemption  
| premium of 25 percent of the aggregate total if the property is  
| redeemed in the first year of the redemption period or 50 percent of  
| the aggregate total if the property is redeemed _during a subsequent_  
| [ ~~in the second~~ ] year of the _applicable_ redemption period.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____Notwithstanding the general redemption period_  
| _prescribed by Subsection (a), (b), or (c), a person 65 years of age_  
| _or older who was an owner of real property subject to a tax sale_  
| _under Section 34.01 that was the owner's residence homestead when_  
| _the suit or the application for the warrant was filed may redeem the_  
| _property on or before the fourth anniversary of the date on which:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the purchaser's deed is filed for record, if the_  
| _property is redeemed under Subsection (a);_  
|  _(2)_ _____the deed of the taxing unit is filed for record, if_  
| _the property is redeemed under Subsection (b); or_  
|  _(3)_ _____the taxing unit files for record the deed from the_  
| _sheriff or constable, if the property is redeemed under Subsection_  
| _(c)._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 33.06(c-1), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (c-1) To obtain an abatement of a pending sale to foreclose  
| the tax lien, the individual must deliver an affidavit stating the  
| facts required to be established by Subsection (a) to the chief  
| appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property,  
| the collector for the taxing unit that requested the order of sale  
| or the attorney representing that unit for the collection of  
| delinquent taxes, and the officer charged with selling the property  
| not later than the fifth day before the date of the sale. After an  
| affidavit is delivered under this subsection, the property may not  
| be sold at a tax sale until the 181st day after the date the  
| individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence  
| homestead. If property is sold in violation of this section, the  
| property owner may file a motion to set aside the sale under the  
| same cause number and in the same court as a judgment reference in  
| the order of sale. The motion must be filed during the applicable  
| redemption period as set forth in Section 34.21(a) _or (d-1)_ or, if  
| the property is bid off to a taxing entity, on or before the 180th  
| day following the date the taxing unit's deed is filed of record,  
| whichever is later. This right is not transferable to a third  
| party.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the redemption of real property sold or bid off at a tax sale for  
| which the deed from the sale or transfer is filed for record on or  
| after the effective date of this Act. The redemption of real  
| property sold or bid off at a tax sale for which the deed from the  
| sale or transfer is filed for record before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect when the deed is filed, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, to lengthen the period for redeeming the  
| residence homestead of a person 65 years of age or older sold at an  
| ad valorem tax sale is approved by the voters. If that amendment is  
| not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

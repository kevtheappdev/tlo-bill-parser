|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to an employment termination report submitted by a law  
| enforcement agency.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 1701.452, Occupations Code, is amended  
| by amending Subsection (b) and adding Subsection (h) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) The head of a law enforcement agency or the head's  
| designee shall include in the report required under Subsection (a)  
| a statement on whether the license holder was honorably discharged,  
| generally discharged, or dishonorably discharged and [ ~~, as required~~  
|  ~~by the commission,~~ ] an explanation of the circumstances under which  
| the person resigned, retired, _separated,_ or was terminated _,_  
| _including, if applicable, a description of any violation of a rule_  
| _or policy committed by the license holder and a copy of the rule or_  
| _policy_. For purposes of this subsection:  
|  (1) "Honorably discharged" means a license holder who,  
| while in good standing and not because of pending or final  
| disciplinary actions or a documented performance problem, retired,  
| resigned, or separated from employment with or died while employed  
| by a law enforcement agency.  
|  (2) "Generally discharged" means a license holder who:  
|  (A) was terminated by, retired or resigned from,  
| or died while in the employ of a law enforcement agency and the  
| separation was related to a disciplinary investigation of conduct  
| that is not included in the definition of dishonorably discharged;  
| or  
|  (B) was terminated by or retired or resigned from  
| a law enforcement agency and the separation was for a documented  
| performance problem and was not because of a reduction in workforce  
| or an at-will employment decision.  
|  (3) "Dishonorably discharged" means a license holder  
| who:  
|  (A) was terminated by a law enforcement agency or  
| retired or resigned in lieu of termination by the agency in relation  
| to allegations of criminal misconduct; or  
|  (B) was terminated by a law enforcement agency or  
| retired or resigned in lieu of termination by the agency for  
| insubordination or untruthfulness.  
|  _(h)_ _____At any time after the head of a law enforcement agency or_  
| _the head's designee submits an employment termination report under_  
| _this section regarding a license holder, the head or the designee_  
| _may submit an amended report to the commission, on a form prescribed_  
| _by the commission, if the head or designee determines amending the_  
| _initial report is necessary based on a reconsideration of the_  
| _circumstances under which the license holder resigned, retired, was_  
| _terminated, or separated from the agency. Not later than the_  
| _seventh business day after the date the amended report is submitted_  
| _to the commission, the head of the law enforcement agency or the_  
| _head's designee shall provide a copy of the amended report to the_  
| _person to whom the initial report was provided as required by_  
| _Subsection (d) or (e)._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 1701.452(b), Occupations Code, as  
| amended by this Act, applies only to a report required to be  
| submitted under Section 1701.452(a), Occupations Code, regarding a  
| resignation, retirement, termination, or separation of a license  
| holder that occurs on or after the effective date of this Act. A  
| resignation, retirement, termination, or separation that occurs  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect on the date of the resignation, retirement, termination, or  
| separation, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

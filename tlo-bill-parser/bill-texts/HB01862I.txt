|  _(c)_ _____An employee benefit plan or health insurance policy_  
| _shall make accessible on the Internet website established under_

| _care services to the patients._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 1451.206(a), Insurance Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The employee benefit plan or health insurance policy  
| shall _:_

| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) An employee benefit plan or health insurance policy may  
| not:  
|  (1) interfere with or prevent an individual who is a

| _policy that provides a written predetermination of benefits to a_  
| _dentist with respect to a dental care service for a patient that_  
| _includes a specific benefit payment or reimbursement amount may not_  
| _pay or reimburse the dentist for providing that service to the_  
| _patient in an amount that is less than the amount set forth in the_  
| _predetermination._

| an employee benefit plan or health insurance policy that provides  
| benefits for dental care services that is delivered, issued for  
| delivery, renewed, or contracted for on or after the effective date  
| of this Act.  An employee benefit plan or health insurance policy  
| that provides benefits for dental care services that is delivered,  
| issued for delivery, renewed, or contracted for before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law as it existed  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

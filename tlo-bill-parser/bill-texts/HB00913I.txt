|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the calculation of the ad valorem rollback tax rate of a  
| taxing unit other than a school district.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 26.04(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) An officer or employee designated by the governing body  
| shall calculate the effective tax rate and the rollback tax rate for  
| the _taxing_ unit, where:  
|  (1) "Effective tax rate" means a rate expressed in  
| dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = (LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)  
|  ; and  
|  (2) "Rollback tax rate" means a rate expressed in  
| dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS RATE x _1.04_ [ ~~1.08~~ ]) + CURRENT DEBT RATE  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 26.041(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  
| tax is required to be collected, the effective tax rate and rollback  
| tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the  
| following formulas:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE) _]_ \-  
| SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| and  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS RATE x _1.04_ [ ~~1.08~~ ]) + CURRENT DEBT RATE -  
| SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following  
| year as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the  
| current total value.  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional  
| sales and use tax the rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit is  
| calculated according to the following formula, regardless of  
| whether the _taxing_ unit levied a property tax in the preceding year:  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS EXPENSE x _1.04_ [ ~~1.08~~ ]) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ] CURRENT  
| _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE  
| \- SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)  
| where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the  
| amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and  
| additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and  
| "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year  
| as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the current  
| total value.  
|  (c) In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing  
| an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales  
| and use tax the effective tax rate and rollback tax rate for the  
| _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the following formulas:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] +  
| SALES TAX LOSS RATE  
| and  
| ROLLBACK TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS EXPENSE x _1.04_ [ ~~1.08~~ ]) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ] CURRENT  
| _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE  
| where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales  
| and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which  
| the information is available by the current total value and "last  
| year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent  
| for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional  
| sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 8876.152(b), Special District Local Laws  
| Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) _Sections 49.236(a)(1) and (2) and (b)_ [ ~~Section 49.236~~ ],  
| Water Code, _apply_ [ ~~as added by Chapter 248 (H.B. 1541), Acts of the~~  
|  ~~78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, applies~~ ] to the district.  
|  SECTION 4. Sections 49.236(a) and (d), Water Code, as added  
| by Chapter 335 (S.B. 392), Acts of the 78th Legislature, Regular

|  (a) Before the board adopts an ad valorem tax rate for the  
| district for debt service, operation and maintenance purposes, or  
| contract purposes, the board shall give notice of each meeting of  
| the board at which the adoption of a tax rate will be considered.

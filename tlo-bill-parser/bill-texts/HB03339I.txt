|  SECTION 11. Section 16.403, Water Code, as added by Chapter  
| 595 (S.B. 181), Acts of the 82nd Legislature, Regular Session,  
| 2011, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 16.403. WATER USE REPORTING. (a) [ ~~The legislature~~  
|  ~~finds that:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~tracking water use over time and evaluating the~~  
|  ~~effects of water conservation programs or strategies are vital~~  
|  ~~components of planning for and managing the state's water resources~~  
|  ~~to estimate and meet future water demand requirements;~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~gallons per capita per day, the common metric~~  
|  ~~used by municipalities and water utilities for water supply~~  
|  ~~planning and the calculation of water use, is not an accurate~~  
|  ~~measure of water use or water conservation because a uniform,~~  
|  ~~consistent methodology for the calculation of gallons per capita~~  
|  ~~per day has not been established;~~  
|  [ ~~(3)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~using a single gallons per capita per day metric~~  
|  ~~to compare the water use of municipalities and water utilities does~~  
|  ~~not produce a reliable comparison because water use is dependent on~~  
|  ~~several variables, including differences in the amount of water~~  
|  ~~used for commercial and industrial sector activities, power~~  
|  ~~production, permanent versus temporary service populations, and~~  
|  ~~agricultural sector production;~~  
|  [ ~~(4)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~if valid water use comparisons and evaluations of~~  
|  ~~a municipality's or water utility's water conservation programs are~~  
|  ~~to be made over time for statewide resource management and water~~  
|  ~~supply planning and permitting purposes, the methodology used to~~  
|  ~~calculate gallons per capita per day must be uniform for all water~~  
|  ~~suppliers;~~  
|  [ ~~(5)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~a municipality's or water utility's industrial~~  
|  ~~and agricultural sector's gallons per capita per day figures are~~  
|  ~~not an accurate measure of actual water use and conservation by~~  
|  ~~entities within those sectors because water use in the industrial~~  
|  ~~and agricultural sectors is not population-dependent and therefore~~  
|  ~~not accurately calculated using a population-based metric; and~~  
|  [ ~~(6)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~a sector-based water use metric, adjusted for~~  
|  ~~variables in water use by municipalities and water utilities, is~~  
|  ~~necessary in order to provide an accurate comparison of water use~~  
|  ~~and water conservation among municipalities and water utilities.~~  
|  [ ~~(b)~~ ] The board and the commission, in consultation with the  
| Water Conservation Advisory Council, shall develop a uniform,  
| consistent methodology and guidance for calculating water use and  
| conservation to be used by a municipality or water utility in  
| developing water conservation plans and preparing reports required  
| under this code. At a minimum, the methodology and guidance must  
| include:  
|  (1) a method of calculating total water use by a  
| municipality or water utility, including water billed and  
| nonrevenue water used, and a method of calculating water use for  
| each sector of water users served by a municipality or water  
| utility;  
|  (2) a method of calculating total water use by a  
| municipality or water utility in gallons per capita per day;  
|  (3) a method of classifying water users within  
| sectors;  
|  (4) a method of calculating water use in the  
| residential sector that includes both single-family and  
| multifamily residences, in gallons per capita per day;  
|  (5) a method of calculating water use in the  
| industrial, agricultural, commercial, and institutional sectors  
| that is not dependent on a municipality's population or the number  
| of customers served by a water utility; and  
|  (6) guidelines on the use of service populations by a  
| municipality or water utility in developing a per-capita-based  
| method of calculation, including guidance on the use of permanent  
| and temporary populations in making calculations.  
|  _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] The board or the commission, as appropriate,  
| shall use the methodology and guidance developed under Subsection  
| _(a)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] in evaluating a water conservation plan, program of water  
| conservation, survey, or other report relating to water  
| conservation submitted to the board or the commission under:  
|  (1) Section 11.1271;  
|  (2) Section 13.146;  
|  (3) [ ~~Section 15.106;~~  
|  [ ~~(4) Section 15.607;~~  
|  [ ~~(5) Section 15.975;~~  
|  [ ~~(6) Section 15.995;~~  
|  [ ~~(7)~~ ] Section 16.012(m);  
|  _(4)_ [ ~~(8)~~ ] Section 16.402; _or_  
|  _(5) Section 16.4021_  
|  [ ~~(9) Section 17.125;~~  
|  [ ~~(10) Section 17.277;~~  
|  [ ~~(11) Section 17.857; or~~  
|  [ ~~(12) Section 17.927~~].  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(d)~~ ] The board, in consultation with the commission  
| and the Water Conservation Advisory Council, shall develop a data  
| collection and reporting program for municipalities and water  
| utilities with more than 3,300 connections.  
|  _(d)_ [ ~~(e)~~ ] Not later than January 1 of each odd-numbered  
| year, the board shall submit to the legislature a report that  
| includes the most recent data relating to:  
|  (1) statewide water usage in the residential,  
| industrial, agricultural, commercial, and institutional sectors;  
| and  
|  (2) the data collection and reporting program  
| developed under Subsection _(c)_ [ ~~(d)~~ ].  
|  _(e)_ _____Data included in a water conservation plan or report_  
| _required under this code and submitted to the board or commission_  
| _must be interpreted in the context of variations in local water use._  
| _The data may not be the only factor considered by the commission in_  
| _determining the highest practicable level of water conservation and_  
| _efficiency achievable in the jurisdiction of a municipality or_  
| _water utility for purposes of Section 11.085(l)._

| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In an application to the board for financial assistance

[ ~~he~~ ]  
| shall state the exemption in _the_ [ ~~his~~ ] application and provide  
| information relating to that exemption as provided by board rules.

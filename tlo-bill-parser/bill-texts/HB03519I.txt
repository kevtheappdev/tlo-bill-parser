---  
|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to disclosure of confidential patient information by a  
| physician or mental health professional.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) The legislature finds that the privilege of  
| confidentiality between a physician and a patient and between a  
| mental health professional and a patient is essential to foster  
| trust and candid communication. This confidentiality should not be  
| breached absent a compelling interest. Over the years, the  
| legislature has created exceptions to the privilege of  
| confidentiality, authorizing physicians and mental health  
| professionals to disclose confidential information in certain  
| circumstances. These exceptions recognize the importance of  
| providing physicians and mental health professionals with  
| discretion, rather than imposing a mandate, to disclose certain  
| patient information to satisfy certain compelling interests.  
|  (b) In light of recent events involving and affecting  
| individuals living with mental health issues, the legislature  
| finds there is a greater need to afford physicians and mental  
| health professionals discretion to disclose patient information  
| when that disclosure could help mitigate harm to the patient or  
| others.  
|  (c) The legislature supports the Supreme Court of Texas  
| holding in _Thapar v. Zezulka_ , 994 S.W.2d 635 (Tex. 1999),  
| concluding that when law states a health professional "may"  
| perform an action, the law grants discretion rather than imposes a  
| requirement. The legislature intends for the exceptions created  
| under this Act to be construed in the same manner, as providing  
| discretion to disclose, but not imposing a duty to disclose. The  
| legislature reiterates this intent by including express language to  
| that effect in the law.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 611.002(b), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) Confidential communications or records may not be  
| disclosed except as provided by Section 611.004 _, 611.0041,_ or  
| 611.0045.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 611.004, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsection (e) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) A professional may disclose confidential information  
| only:  
|  (1) to a governmental agency if the disclosure is  
| required or authorized by law;  
|  (2) to _a person reasonably able to prevent or mitigate_  
| _a threat, including the subject of the threat,_ [ ~~medical or law~~  
|  ~~enforcement personnel~~ ] if the professional _, in good faith, believes_  
| [ ~~determines~~ ] that _disclosure is necessary to prevent or mitigate a_  
| _serious and_ [ ~~there is a probability of~~ ] imminent _threat_ [
~~physical~~  
|  ~~injury by the patient~~ ] to the _health or safety of a person or the_  
| _public_ [ ~~patient or others or there is a probability of immediate~~  
|  ~~mental or emotional injury to the patient~~ ];  
|  (3) to qualified personnel for management audits,  
| financial audits, program evaluations, or research, in accordance  
| with Subsection (b);  
|  (4) to a person who has the written consent of the  
| patient, or a parent if the patient is a minor, or a guardian if the  
| patient has been adjudicated as incompetent to manage the patient's  
| personal affairs;  
|  (5) to the patient's personal representative if the  
| patient is deceased;  
|  (6) to individuals, corporations, or governmental  
| agencies involved in paying or collecting fees for mental or  
| emotional health services provided by a professional;  
|  (7) to other professionals and personnel under the  
| professionals' direction who participate in the diagnosis,  
| evaluation, or treatment of the patient;  
|  (8) in an official legislative inquiry relating to a  
| state hospital or state school as provided by Subsection (c);  
|  (9) to designated persons or personnel of a  
| correctional facility in which a person is detained if the  
| disclosure is for the sole purpose of providing treatment and  
| health care to the person in custody;  
|  (10) to an employee or agent of the professional who  
| requires mental health care information to provide mental health  
| care services or in complying with statutory, licensing, or  
| accreditation requirements, if the professional has taken  
| appropriate action to ensure that the employee or agent:  
|  (A) will not use or disclose the information for  
| any other purposes; and  
|  (B) will take appropriate steps to protect the  
| information; [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (11) to satisfy a request for medical records of a  
| deceased or incompetent person pursuant to Section 74.051(e), Civil  
| Practice and Remedies Code _; or_

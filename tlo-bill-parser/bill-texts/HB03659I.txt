|  (a) A _child-care provider_ [ ~~license holder~~ ] shall maintain  
| liability insurance coverage in the amount of $300,000 for each  
| occurrence of negligence. An insurance policy or contract required  
| under this section must cover injury to a child that occurs while

| an unexpired and uncancelled insurance policy or contract that  
| meets the requirements of this section.  
|  (d) The insurance policy or contract shall be maintained at  
| all times in an amount as required by this section. Failure by a  
| _child-care provider_ [ ~~license holder~~ ] to renew the policy or  
| contract or to maintain the policy or contract in the required  
| amount is a ground for suspension or revocation of the _child-care_  
| _provider's_ [ ~~license holder's~~ ] license _, listing, or registration_  
| under this chapter.

| home or listed or registered family home has an unexpired and  
| uncancelled insurance policy or contract that meets the  
| requirements of Section 42.049, Human Resources Code, as amended by

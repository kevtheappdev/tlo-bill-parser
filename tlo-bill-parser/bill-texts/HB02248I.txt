| court _with_ [ ~~of competent~~ ] jurisdiction _over probate proceedings
for_

| _initiated_.  A cemetery organization or funeral establishment shall  
| not be liable for refusing to accept the decedent's remains, or to  
| inter or otherwise dispose of the decedent's remains, until it  
| receives a court order or other suitable confirmation that the  
| dispute has been resolved or settled.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 711.004(c), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) If the consent required by Subsection (a) cannot be  
| obtained, the remains may be removed by permission of a _county_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] court of the county in which the cemetery is  
| located. Before the date of application to the court for  
| permission to remove remains under this subsection, notice must be  
| given to:

| in which the remains are interred or if the cemetery organization  
| cannot be located or does not exist, the Texas Historical  
| Commission;  
|  (2) each person whose consent is required for removal  
| of the remains under Subsection (a); and  
|  (3) any other person that the court requires to be  
| served.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 711.002, Health and Safety Code, as  
| amended by this Act, applies only to the validity of a document  
| executed on or after the effective date of this Act. The validity  
| of a document executed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the document was executed,  
| and that law continues in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this  
| section, the changes in law made by this Act apply to:  
|  (1) an instrument described by Section 711.002(a)(1),  
| Health and Safety Code, created before, on, or after the effective  
| date of this Act;  
|  (2) a judicial proceeding concerning an instrument  
| described by Subdivision (1) of this subsection that:  
|  (A) commences on or after the effective date of  
| this Act; or  
|  (B) is pending on the effective date of this Act;  
| and  
|  (3) an application to a court to remove remains under  
| Section 711.004(c), Health and Safety Code, as amended by this Act,  
| submitted on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  (b) If the court finds that application of a provision of  
| this Act would substantially interfere with the effective conduct  
| of a judicial proceeding concerning an instrument described by  
| Subsection (a)(1) of this section that is pending on the effective  
| date of this Act or prejudice the rights of a party to the  
| proceeding, the provision of this Act does not apply, and the law in  
| effect immediately before the effective date of this Act applies in  
| those circumstances.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

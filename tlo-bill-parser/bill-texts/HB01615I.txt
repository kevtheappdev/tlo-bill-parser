|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the state's burden of proof in certain asset forfeiture  
| proceedings under the Code of Criminal Procedure.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 59.02, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (c) and adding Subsection (c-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) An owner or interest holder's interest in property may  
| not be forfeited under this chapter if the owner or interest holder  
| [ ~~proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner or~~  
|  ~~interest holder~~ ] acquired and perfected the interest:  
|  (1) before or during the act or omission giving rise to  
| forfeiture or, if the property is real property, _the owner or_  
| _interest holder_ [ ~~he~~ ] acquired an ownership interest, security  
| interest, or lien interest before a lis pendens notice was filed  
| under Article 59.04(g) _,_ [ ~~of this code~~ ] and did not know or should  
| not reasonably have known of the act or omission giving rise to the  
| forfeiture or that it was likely to occur at or before the time of  
| acquiring and perfecting the interest or, if the property is real  
| property, at or before the time of acquiring the ownership  
| interest, security interest, or lien interest; or  
|  (2) after the act or omission giving rise to the  
| forfeiture, but before the seizure of the property, and only if the  
| owner or interest holder:  
|  (A) was, at the time that the interest in the  
| property was acquired, an owner or interest holder for value; and  
|  (B) was without reasonable cause to believe that  
| the property was contraband and did not purposefully avoid learning  
| that the property was contraband.  
|  _(c-1)_ _____The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance_  
| _of the evidence that the circumstances described by Subsection (c)_  
| _do not apply to property that is subject to seizure and forfeiture_  
| _under this chapter._  
|  SECTION 2. Article 59.02(h), Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subdivision (1) and adding Subdivision (1-a) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (1) An owner or interest holder's interest in property  
| may not be forfeited under this chapter if [ ~~at the forfeiture~~  
|  ~~hearing the owner or interest holder proves by a preponderance of~~  
|  ~~the evidence that~~ ] the owner or interest holder was not a party to  
| the offense giving rise to the forfeiture and [ ~~that~~ ] the  
| contraband:  
|  (A) was stolen from the owner or interest holder  
| before being used in the commission of the offense giving rise to  
| the forfeiture;  
|  (B) was purchased with:  
|  (i) money stolen from the owner or interest  
| holder; or  
|  (ii) proceeds from the sale of property  
| stolen from the owner or interest holder; or  
|  (C) was used or intended to be used without the  
| effective consent of the owner or interest holder in the commission  
| of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture.  
|  _(1-a) The state has the burden of proving by a_  
| _preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances described by_  
| _Subdivision (1) do not apply to property that is subject to seizure_  
| _and forfeiture under this chapter._  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a forfeiture proceeding that begins on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. A forfeiture proceeding that begins before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the proceeding begins, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) Unless the juvenile court waives jurisdiction under  
| Section 54.02, Family Code, and certifies the individual for  
| criminal prosecution or the juvenile court has previously waived  
| jurisdiction under that section and certified the individual for  
| criminal prosecution, a person may not be prosecuted for or  
| convicted of any offense committed before reaching _18_ [ ~~17~~ ] years of  
| age except an offense described by Subsections (a)(1)-(5).  
|  (d) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a person may not be

| than 15 years of age is presumed incapable of committing an offense  
| described by Subsection (a)(4) or (5), other than an offense under a

| court, the juvenile court shall proceed as provided by Sections

| applicable;  
|  (2) the proceeding is not complete before the  
| respondent becomes _19 or 20_ [ ~~18 or 19~~ ] years of age, as applicable;

|  (B) violated a condition of release under  
| supervision of the department.  
|  SECTION 4.04. Section 54.02(j), Family Code, is amended to

|  (B) after due diligence of the state it was not  
| practicable to proceed in juvenile court before the _19th_ [ ~~18th~~ ]  
| birthday of the person because:  
|  (i) the state did not have probable cause to  
| proceed in juvenile court and new evidence has been found since the  
| _19th_ [ ~~18th~~ ] birthday of the person;  
|  (ii) the person could not be found; or  
|  (iii) a previous transfer order was  
| reversed by an appellate court or set aside by a district court; and  
|  (5) the juvenile court determines that there is  
| probable cause to believe that the child before the court committed  
| the offense alleged.

| person may be _18_ [ ~~17~~ ] years of age or older at the time of  
| commitment.  
|  (l) Except as provided by Subsection (q), a court or jury  
| may place a child on probation under Subsection (d)(1) for any  
| period, except that probation may not continue on or after the  
| child's _19th_ [ ~~18th~~ ] birthday. Except as provided by Subsection  
| (q), the court may, before the period of probation ends, extend the  
| probation for any period, except that the probation may not extend  
| to or after the child's _19th_ [ ~~18th~~ ] birthday.  
|  (q) If a court or jury sentences a child to commitment in the  
| Texas Juvenile Justice Department or a post-adjudication secure  
| correctional facility under Subsection (d)(3) for a term of not  
| more than 10 years, the court or jury may place the child on  
| probation under Subsection (d)(1) as an alternative to making the  
| disposition under Subsection (d)(3). The court shall prescribe  
| the period of probation ordered under this subsection for a term of  
| not more than 10 years. The court may, before the sentence of  
| probation expires, extend the probationary period under Section  
| 54.05, except that the sentence of probation and any extension may  
| not exceed 10 years. The court may, before the child's _20th_ [ ~~19th~~ ]  
| birthday, discharge the child from the sentence of probation. If a  
| sentence of probation ordered under this subsection and any  
| extension of probation ordered under Section 54.05 will continue

placed on  
| determinate sentence probation under Section 54.04(q).  
|  SECTION 4.08. Sections 54.041(b) and (h), Family Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) If a child is found to have engaged in delinquent  
| conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision arising from  
| the commission of an offense in which property damage or loss or  
| personal injury occurred, the juvenile court, on notice to all  
| persons affected and on hearing, may order the child or a parent to  
| make full or partial restitution to the victim of the offense. The  
| program of restitution must promote the rehabilitation of the  
| child, be appropriate to the age and physical, emotional, and  
| mental abilities of the child, and not conflict with the child's  
| schooling. When practicable and subject to court supervision, the  
| court may approve a restitution program based on a settlement  
| between the child and the victim of the offense. An order under  
| this subsection may provide for periodic payments by the child or a  
| parent of the child for the period specified in the order but except  
| as provided by Subsection (h), that period may not extend past the  
| date of the _19th_ [ ~~18th~~ ] birthday of the child or past the date the

| court shall require the payment of any unpaid restitution as a  
| condition of the community supervision.  The liability of the

| district court for supervision.

| hearing to determine whether to transfer the child to an  
| appropriate district court or discharge the child from the sentence  
| of probation.

| relating to the civil liability of certain businesses in connection  
| with allowing concealed handguns on the business premises.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Title 4, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is  
| amended by adding Chapter 95A to read as follows:  
| _CHAPTER 95A. LIABILITY OF BUSINESS IN CONNECTION WITH ALLOWING_  
| _CONCEALED HANDGUNS_  
|  _Sec._ ___95A.001._ _____DEFINITION. In this chapter, "license_  
| _holder" means a person licensed to carry a handgun under Subchapter_  
| _H, Chapter 411, Government Code._  
|  _Sec._ ___95A.002._ _____IMMUNITY OF BUSINESS THAT ALLOWS CONCEALED_  
| _HANDGUNS. A person with control over the premises of a business who_  
| _allows entry on the premises by a license holder with a concealed_  
| _handgun is not liable based solely on that permission for damages_  
| _arising from the lawful carrying of a concealed handgun on the_  
| _premises._  
|  _Sec._ ___95A.003._ _____ORAL OR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION. For purposes_  
| _of this chapter, the lack of an oral or written communication that_

| that accrued before the effective date of this Act is governed by  
| the law applicable to the cause of action immediately before that  
| date, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

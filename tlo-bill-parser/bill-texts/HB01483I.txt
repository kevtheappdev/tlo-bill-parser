|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a pilot program for assisting certain recipients of  
| public benefits to gain permanent self-sufficiency.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 531, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 531.02241 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___531.02241._ _____PILOT PROGRAM FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY OF_  
| _CERTAIN PERSONS RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR SUPPLEMENTAL_  
| _NUTRITION ASSISTANCE BENEFITS. (a) In this section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Financial assistance benefits" means money_  
| _payments under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families_  
| _program operated under Chapter 31, Human Resources Code, or under_  
| _the state temporary assistance and support services program_  
| _operated under Chapter 34, Human Resources Code._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Living wage" means an amount of money, determined_  
| _by a market-based calculation that uses geographically specific_  
| _expenditure data, that is sufficient to meet a family's minimum_  
| _necessary spending on basic needs, including food, child care,_  
| _health insurance, housing, and transportation._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Self-sufficiency" means being employed in a_  
| _position that pays a living wage, having financial savings in an_  
| _amount that is equal to at least $1,000 per member of a family's_  
| _household, and owing only a reasonable amount of harmful or_  
| _unsecure debt._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Slow reduction scale" means a graduated plan for_  
| _reducing financial assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance_  
| _benefits that correlates with a phase of the pilot program's_  
| _progressive stages toward self-sufficiency._  
|  _(5)_ _____"Supplemental nutrition assistance benefits"_  
| _means money payments under the supplemental nutrition assistance_  
| _program operated under Chapter 33, Human Resources Code._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission shall develop and implement a pilot_  
| _program for assisting not more than 500 eligible families to gain_  
| _permanent self-sufficiency and no longer require financial_  
| _assistance, supplemental nutrition assistance, or other_  
| _means-tested public benefits. If the number of families_  
| _participating in the program during a year reaches capacity for_  
| _that year as determined by the commission, the number of families_  
| _that may be served under the program in the following year may be_  
| _increased by 20 percent._  
|  _(c)_ _____The pilot program will test extending, for at least 24_  
| _months but not more than 60 months, financial assistance and_  
| _supplemental nutrition assistance benefits by deferring the_  
| _application of income and asset limit eligibility requirements for_  
| _continuation of the benefits and reducing the benefits using a slow_  
| _reduction scale. The amount of any income limit requirement that is_  
| _applied must be in an amount that does not exceed the amount, based_  
| _on a participating family's makeup and the living wage in the_  
| _family's geographical area of residence, determined to be necessary_  
| _for the purposes of the program. The deferral of the application of_  
| _any asset limit requirement must allow the family to have assets in_  
| _an amount that is equal to or less than $1,000 per member of the_  
| _family's household._  
|  _(d)_ _____The pilot program must be designed to allow social_  
| _services providers, public benefit offices, and other community_  
| _partners to refer potential participating families to the program._  
|  _(e)_ _____A family is eligible to participate in the pilot program_  
| _established under this section if the family:_  
|  _(1)_ _____includes one or more members who are recipients of_  
| _financial assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance_  
| _benefits, at least one of whom is:_  
|  _(A)_ _____at least 18 but not more than 62 years of age;_  
| _and_  
|  _(B)_ _____willing, and physically and legally able, to_  
| _be employed; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____has a total household income that is less than a_  
| _living wage based on the family's makeup and geographical area of_  
| _residence._  
|  _(f)_ _____The pilot program must be designed to assist eligible_  
| _participating families in attaining self-sufficiency by:_  
|  _(1)_ _____identifying eligibility requirements for the_  
| _continuation of financial assistance or supplemental nutrition_  
| _assistance benefits, the application of which may be deferred for a_  
| _limited period and that, if applied, would impede self-sufficiency;_  
|  _(2)_ _____implementing strategies, including deferring the_  
| _application of the eligibility requirements identified in_  
| _Subdivision (1), to remove barriers to self-sufficiency; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____moving eligible participating families through_  
| _progressive stages toward self-sufficiency that include the_  
| _following phases:_  
|  _(A)_ _____an initial phase in which a family moves out_  
| _of an emergent crisis by securing housing, medical care, and_  
| _financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance_  
| _benefits, as necessary;_  
|  _(B) a second phase in which:_  
|  _(i)_ _____the family moves toward stability by_  
| _securing employment and, if necessary, child care and by_  
| _participating in services that build the financial management_  
| _skills necessary to meet financial goals; and_  
|  _(ii)_ _____the family's financial assistance and_  
| _supplemental nutrition assistance benefits are reduced according_  
| _to the following scale:_  
|  _(a)_ _____on reaching 25 percent of the_  
| _family's living wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 10_  
| _percent;_  
|  _(b)_ _____on reaching 50 percent of the_  
| _family's living wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 25_  
| _percent; and_  
|  _(c)_ _____on reaching 75 percent of the_  
| _family's living wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 50_  
| _percent;_  
|  _(C) a third phase in which the family:_  
|  _(i)_ _____transitions to self-sufficiency by_  
| _securing employment that pays a living wage, reducing debt, and_  
| _building savings; and_  
|  _(ii)_ _____becomes ineligible for financial_  
| _assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits on_  
| _reaching 100 percent of the family's living wage; and_  
|  _(D)_ _____a final phase in which the family attains_  
| _self-sufficiency by retaining employment that pays a living wage,_  
| _amassing at least $1,000 per member of the family's household, and_  
| _having manageable debt so that the family will no longer be_  
| _dependent on financial assistance, supplemental nutrition_  
| _assistance, or other means-tested public benefits for at least six_  
| _months following the date the family stops participating in the_  
| _program._  
|  _(g)_ _____A person from a family that wishes to participate in the_  
| _pilot program must attend an in-person intake meeting with a_  
| _program case manager. During the intake meeting the case manager_

| _household financial budget;_  
|  _(3)_ _____assess the family members' current financial and_  
| _career situations;_  
|  _(4)_ _____collaborate with the person to develop and_  
| _implement strategies for removing barriers to the family attaining_  
| _self-sufficiency, including deferring the application of income_  
| _and asset limit eligibility requirements for continuation of_  
| _financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance_  
| _benefits; and_  
|  _(5)_ _____if the person's family is determined to be eligible_  
| _for and chooses to participate in the program, schedule a follow-up_  
| _meeting to further assess the family's crisis, review available_  
| _referral services, and create a service plan._  
|  _(h)_ _____The pilot program must provide each participating_  
| _family with holistic, wraparound case management services,_  
| _including the strategic use of financial assistance and_  
| _supplemental nutrition assistance benefits, to ensure that goals_  
| _included in the family's service plan are achieved. A_  
| _participating family must be assigned a program case manager who_  
| _shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____if the family is determined to be eligible,_  
| _provide the family with a verification of the deferred application_  
| _of asset and income limits described by Subsection (c), allowing_  
| _the family to continue receiving financial assistance and_  
| _supplemental nutrition assistance benefits on a slow reduction_  
| _scale;_  
|  _(2)_ _____assess, at the follow-up meeting scheduled under_

| _program begins operation;_  
|  _(2)_ _____recruiting eligible families to participate in the_  
| _program;_

| _wraparound case management services under the program; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____after the program begins operation, collecting and_

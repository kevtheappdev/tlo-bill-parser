|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to asset forfeiture proceedings under the Code of Criminal  
| Procedure.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 59.05(d), Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) A final conviction for an underlying offense is _required_  
| [ ~~not a requirement~~ ] for forfeiture under this chapter. _The court_  
| _shall dismiss a forfeiture proceeding on proof_ [ ~~An owner or~~  
|  ~~interest holder may present evidence~~ ] of a dismissal or acquittal  
| of _the_ [ ~~an~~ ] underlying offense [ ~~in a forfeiture proceeding, and~~  
|  ~~evidence of an acquittal raises a presumption that the property or~~  
|  ~~interest that is the subject of the hearing is nonforfeitable. This~~  
|  ~~presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the owner or interest~~  
|  ~~holder knew or should have known that the property was contraband~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to property subject to forfeiture on the basis of an offense  
| committed on or after the effective date of this Act. Property  
| subject to forfeiture on the basis of an offense committed before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on  
| the date the offense was committed, and the former law is continued  
| in effect for that purpose. For purposes of this section, an  
| offense was committed before the effective date of this Act if any  
| element of the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

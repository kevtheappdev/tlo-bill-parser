|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to retirement benefits for certain peace officers who are  
| members of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 821.001, Government Code, is amended by  
| adding Subdivision (11-a) to read as follows:  
|  _(11-a)_ _____"Peace officer" means a member of the_  
| _retirement system who is elected, employed, or appointed as a peace_  
| _officer under Article 2.12, Code of Criminal Procedure, Section_  
| _37.081 or 51.203, Education Code, or other law._  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter C, Chapter 824, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Sections 824.2025 and 824.2035 to read as  
| follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___824.2025._ _____ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICE RETIREMENT FOR PEACE_  
| _OFFICERS. (a)_ ___This section applies notwithstanding any other law,_  
| _including Section 824.202._  
|  _(b)_ _____A member who is at least 55 years old and who has at_  
| _least 10 years of service credit as a peace officer engaged in law_  
| _enforcement activities by a school district or institution of_  
| _higher education is eligible to retire and receive a service_  
| _retirement annuity._  
|  _(c)_ _____A member who has at least 20 years of service credit as a_  
| _peace officer is eligible to retire regardless of age and receive a_  
| _standard service retirement annuity in an amount provided by_  
| _Section 824.203 or 824.2035, as applicable._  
|  _(d)_ _____The standard combined service retirement annuity that_  
| _is payable under Section 824.203 or 824.2035, as applicable, is_  
| _based on retirement on or after the attainment of the normal_  
| _retirement age, which for purposes of this section is the earlier of_  
| _either the age of 57 or the age at which the sum of the member's age_  
| _and amount of service credit equals the number 80. The annuity of a_  
| _peace officer who retires before reaching the age of 57 under any_  
| _eligibility criteria is actuarially reduced by five percent for_  
| _each year of difference between the member's age at retirement and_  
| _57\. The actuarial reduction described by this section is in_  
| _addition to any other actuarial reduction required by law._  
|  _(e)_ _____A peace officer who retires before attaining the age of_  
| _50 is entitled only to an annuity that is actuarially reduced from_  
| _the annuity available at the age of 50 to the peace officer whose_  
| _service credit annuity amount is based on the sum of the member's_  
| _age and amount of peace officer service credit and other service_  
| _credit, and is not entitled to have the annuity recalculated at_  
| _normal retirement age. The standard or reduced annuity under this_  
| _section is payable from appropriate accounts described by Section_  
| _825.306._  
|  _Sec._ ___824.2035._ _____SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN_  
| _PEACE OFFICERS._ ___(a)_ ___This section applies to a member subject to_  
| _Section 824.2025(c) who renders service as a peace officer after_  
| _September 1, 2020._  
|  _(b)_ _____The standard service retirement annuity payable for a_  
| _peace officer subject to this section is an amount computed on the_  
| _basis of the member's average annual compensation for the five_  
| _years of service, whether or not consecutive, in which the member_  
| _received the highest annual compensation, times the sum of the_  
| _percentage factor used in the computation of a standard service_  
| _retirement annuity under Section 824.203 plus 0.5 percent._  
|  _(c)_ _____Optional retirement annuities provided by Section_  
| _824.204 are available to a member eligible to receive a service_  
| _retirement annuity under this section._  
|  _(d)_ _____The total combined amount of an annuity under this_  
| _section may not be less than the authorized benefit under_  
| _Subsection (b) subtracted by any amount necessary because of_  
| _selection of an optional annuity, because of retirement before the_  
| _normal retirement age, or as provided by Subsection (e)._  
|  _(e)_ _____The standard combined service retirement annuity_  
| _payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a peace officer_  
| _may not exceed 100 percent of the average compensation computed_  
| _under Subsection (b)._  
|  _(f)_ _____For purposes of this section, service as a peace officer_  
| _is creditable as provided by rule of the board of trustees or on a_  
| _month-to-month basis, whichever is greater._  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter D, Chapter 824, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 824.3045 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___824.3045._ _____DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN_  
| _PEACE OFFICERS. (a) An annuity payable for a disability resulting_  
| _from a risk to which peace officers are exposed because of the_  
| _nature of the officers' duties is payable under the same terms and_  
| _conditions that apply to other disability retirement annuities_  
| _under this subtitle._  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (c), a disability_  
| _retirement annuity under this section is an amount, but not more_  
| _than 100 percent, computed on the basis of the officer's average_  
| _annual compensation, times a percentage derived by application of_  
| _Section 824.2035(b)._  
|  _(c)_ _____A disability retirement annuity under this section is_  
| _not reducible because of age and may not be less than 50 percent of_  
| _the officer's average annual compensation regardless of the amount_  
| _of service credited to the officer._  
|  _(d)_ _____If a retiring member or retiree under this section_  
| _presents evidence satisfactory to the retirement system that the_  
| _person's disability makes the person incapable of substantial_  
| _gainful activity solely because of the disability and is considered_

| _retirement annuity to 100 percent of the officer's average annual_  
| _compensation._  
|  _(e)_ _____An annuity increase under Subsection (d) is not payable_

| _SUBCHAPTER D. MANDATORY PAYMENTS_  
|  _Sec._ ___298F.151._ _____MANDATORY PAYMENTS BASED ON PAYING PROVIDER_  
| _NET PATIENT REVENUE. (a) If the board authorizes a health care_  
| _provider participation program under this chapter, the board may_  
| _require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net_  
| _patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located_  
| _in the district. The board may provide for the mandatory payment to_  
| _be assessed periodically throughout the year. The board shall_  
| _provide an institutional health care provider written notice of_  
| _each assessment under this subsection, and the provider has 30_  
| _calendar days following the date of receipt of the notice to pay the_  
| _assessment. In the first year in which the mandatory payment is_  
| _required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient_  
| _revenue of an institutional health care provider, which is the_  
| _amount of that revenue as reported in the provider's Medicare cost_  
| _report submitted for the previous fiscal year or for the closest_  
| _subsequent fiscal year for which the provider submitted the_  
| _Medicare cost report. If the mandatory payment is required, the_  
| _district shall update the amount of the mandatory payment on an_  
| _annual basis._  
|  _(b)_ _____The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this_  
| _chapter must be uniformly proportionate with the amount of net_  
| _patient revenue generated by each paying provider in the district_  
| _as permitted under federal law. A health care provider_  
| _participation program authorized under this chapter may not hold_  
| _harmless any institutional health care provider, as required under_  
| _42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w)._  
|  
|  _(c)_ _____If the board requires a mandatory payment authorized_  
| _under this chapter, the board shall set the amount of the mandatory_  
| _payment, subject to the limitations of this chapter. The aggregate_  
| _amount of the mandatory payments required of all paying providers_  
| _in the district may not exceed six percent of the aggregate net_  
| _patient revenue from hospital services provided by all paying_  
| _providers in the district._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to Subsection (c), if the board requires a_  
| _mandatory payment authorized under this chapter, the board shall_  
| _set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will_  
| _generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of_  
| _the district for activities under this chapter and to fund an_  
| _intergovernmental transfer described by Section 298F.103(c)(1)._  
| _The annual amount of revenue from mandatory payments that shall be_  
| _paid for administrative expenses of the program by the district may_  
| _not exceed 2.5 percent of the total revenue generated from the_  
| _mandatory payments, regardless of actual expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _____A paying provider may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient._  
|  _(f)_ _____A mandatory payment assessed under this chapter is not a_

| _PAYMENTS._ ___(a)_ ___The district may designate an official of the_  
| _district or contract with another person to assess and collect the_  
| _mandatory payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____The person charged by the district with the assessment_  
| _and collection of mandatory payments shall charge and deduct from_  
| _the mandatory payments collected for the district a collection fee_  
| _in an amount not to exceed the person's usual and customary charges_  
| _for like services._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the person charged with the assessment and collection_  
| _of mandatory payments is an official of the district, any revenue_  
| _from a collection fee charged under Subsection (b) shall be_  
| _deposited in the district general fund and, if appropriate, shall_  
| _be reported as fees of the district._  
|  _Sec._ ___298F.153._ _____PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE; LIMITATION OF AUTHORITY. (a) The purpose of this chapter_  
| _is to authorize the district to establish a program to enable the_  
| _district to collect mandatory payments from institutional health_  
| _care providers to fund the nonfederal share of a Medicaid_  
| _supplemental payment program or the Medicaid managed care rate_  
| _enhancements for nonpublic hospitals to support the provision of_  
| _health care by institutional health care providers to district_  
| _residents in need of health care._  
|  _(b)_ _____This chapter does not authorize the district to collect_  
| _mandatory payments for the purpose of raising general revenue or_  
| _any amount in excess of the amount reasonably necessary to fund the_  
| _nonfederal share of a Medicaid supplemental payment program or_  
| _Medicaid managed care rate enhancements for nonpublic hospitals and_  
| _to cover the administrative expenses of the district associated_  
| _with activities under this chapter and other amounts for which the_  
| _fund may be used as described by Section 298F.103(c)._  
|  _(c)_ _____To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the board may provide by_  
| _rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the_  
| _requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services. A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose,_  
| _or materially expand the legal or financial liability or_  
| _responsibility of the district or an institutional health care_  
| _provider in the district beyond the provisions of this chapter._  
| _This section does not require the board to adopt a rule._  
|  _(d)_ _____The district may only assess and collect a mandatory_  
| _payment authorized under this chapter if a waiver program, uniform_  
| _rate enhancement, or reimbursement described by Section_  
| _298F.103(c)(1) is available to the district._  
|  SECTION 2. As soon as practicable after the expiration of  
| the authority of the Bexar County Hospital District to administer  
| and operate a health care provider participation program under  
| Chapter 298F, Health and Safety Code, as added by this Act, the  
| board of hospital managers of the Bexar County Hospital District  
| shall transfer to each institutional health care provider in the  
| district that provider's proportionate share of any remaining funds  
| in any local provider participation fund created by the district  
| under Section 298F.103, Health and Safety Code, as added by this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 3. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution.  If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

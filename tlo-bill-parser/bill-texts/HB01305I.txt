|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a cost-of-living increase applicable to death benefits  
| paid under the workers' compensation system.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 408.181, Labor Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (b) and adding Subsection (b-1) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) Subject to Section 408.061, the amount of a death  
| benefit is equal to 75 percent of the employee's average weekly  
| wage. _Notwithstanding Section 408.061, the amount of a death_  
| _benefit is adjusted in accordance with Subsection (b-1) each_  
| _calendar year as necessary to reflect inflation._  
|  _(b-1)_ _____Not later than November 1 of each year, the_  
| _commissioner shall set the rate of the adjustment described by_  
| _Subsection (b) for the next calendar year to equal the percentage_  
| _increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners_  
| _and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) most recently published by the Bureau_  
| _of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor and_  
| _used by the United States Social Security Administration to provide_  
| _a cost-of-living adjustment for social security benefit payments_  
| _payable beginning in January of the next year. Not later than_  
| _January 1 of each year, an insurance carrier shall recompute the_  
| _amount of a death benefit to be paid under this section by applying_  
| _the adjustment computed by the commissioner under this subsection_  
| _to the amount otherwise required to be paid under Subsection (b)._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a claim for workers' compensation benefits based on a  
| compensable injury that occurs on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A claim based on a compensable injury that occurs before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on  
| the date the compensable injury occurred, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the personal needs allowance for certain Medicaid  
| recipients who are residents of long-term care facilities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 32.024(w), Human Resources Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (w) The executive commissioner shall set a personal needs  
| allowance of not less than _$75_ [ ~~$60~~ ] a month for a resident of a  
| convalescent or nursing facility or related institution licensed  
| under Chapter 242, Health and Safety Code, assisted living  
| facility, ICF-IID facility, or other similar long-term care  
| facility who receives medical assistance.  The commission may send  
| the personal needs allowance directly to a resident who receives  
| Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (42 U.S.C. Section 1381 et  
| seq.).  This subsection does not apply to a resident who is  
| participating in a medical assistance waiver program administered  
| by the commission.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 32.024(w), Human Resources Code, applies only to a personal needs  
| allowance paid on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to verification by a credit services organization of a  
| consumer's ability to repay an extension of consumer credit.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter D, Chapter 393, Finance Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 393.308 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___393.308._ _____ENSURING ABILITY TO REPAY EXTENSION OF_  
| _CONSUMER CREDIT. (a) A credit services organization may not obtain_  
| _for a consumer or assist a consumer in obtaining, including by_  
| _providing advice, an extension of consumer credit unless the credit_  
| _services organization finds, using independently verifiable_  
| _documentation of income and obligations, that the consumer can_  
| _reasonably:_  
|  _(1)_ _____repay in cash, in accordance with the time and_  
| _schedule of payments established by contract and applicable law,_  
| _the extension of consumer credit and all associated fees and costs;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____pay due payments on all known obligations of the_  
| _consumer concurrently._  
|  _(b)_ _____The credit services organization must retain all_  
| _documentation used under Subsection (a) to establish the ability of_  
| _the consumer to repay an extension of consumer credit._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an extension of consumer credit made on or after the effective date  
| of this Act. An extension of consumer credit made before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the extension of consumer credit was made, and the former law  
| is continued in effect for that purpose.  For purposes of this  
| section, a refinance or renewal of an extension of consumer credit  
| is considered made on the date the extension of consumer credit  
| being refinanced or renewed was made.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

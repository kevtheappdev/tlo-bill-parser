| Practice and Remedies Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In any action or arbitration proceeding for damages  
| arising out of the provision of professional services by a licensed  
| or registered professional, _a claimant_ [ ~~the plaintiff~~ ] shall be  
| required to file with the complaint an affidavit of a third-party  
| licensed architect, licensed professional engineer, registered  
| landscape architect, or registered professional land surveyor who:  
|  (1) is competent to testify;  
|  (2) holds the same professional license or

|  (c) The contemporaneous filing requirement of Subsection  
| (a) shall not apply to any case in which the period of limitation  
| will expire within 10 days of the date of filing and, because of  
| such time constraints, _a claimant_ [ ~~the plaintiff~~ ] has alleged that  
| an affidavit of a third-party licensed architect, licensed  
| professional engineer, registered landscape architect, or  
| registered professional land surveyor could not be prepared. In  
| such cases, the _claimant_ [ ~~plaintiff~~ ] shall have 30 days after the

| of the complaint against the defendant. This dismissal may be with  
| prejudice.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an action or arbitration proceeding commenced on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. An action or arbitration proceeding  
| commenced before the effective date of this Act is governed by the  
| law in effect immediately before the effective date of this Act, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| the office may make a disbursement from the fund for a purpose for

| contract or event support contract.  
|  (b) In considering whether to make a disbursement from the  
| fund, the office may not consider a contingency clause in an event  
| support contract as relieving a local organizing committee's,  
| endorsing municipality's, or endorsing county's obligation to pay a  
| cost under the contract.  
|  (c) If the office makes a disbursement from the fund, the  
| office shall satisfy the obligation proportionately from the local

| After the conclusion of an event, the office shall compare  
| information on the actual attendance figures provided under Section  
| 478.0251 with the estimated attendance numbers used to determine  
| the incremental increase in tax receipts under Section 478.0102.  
| If the actual attendance figures are significantly lower than the  
| estimated attendance numbers, the office may reduce the amount of a  
| disbursement from the fund for an endorsing entity:  
|  (1) in proportion to the discrepancy between the  
| actual and estimated attendance; and  
|  (2) in proportion to the amount the entity contributed  
| to the fund.  
|  (b) The office by rule shall:  
|  (1) define "significantly lower" for purposes of this  
| section; and  
|  (2) provide the manner in which the office may  
| proportionately reduce a disbursement.  
|  (c) This section does not affect the remittance under  
| Section 478.0207 of any money remaining in the fund. (V.A.C.S. Art.

| an endorsing county, or this state to a site selection organization  
| under a games support contract or event support contract.  
|  (b) Subject to Sections 478.0202 and 478.0205, the

|  Sec. 478.0205. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN DISBURSEMENTS. (a) A  
| disbursement from the fund is limited to five percent of the cost of  
| a structural improvement or a fixture if:  
|  (1) an obligation is incurred under a games support  
| contract or event support contract to make the improvement or add  
| the fixture to a site for an event; and  
|  (2) the improvement or fixture is expected to derive  
| most of its value in subsequent uses of the site for future events.  
|  (b) The remainder of an obligation described by Subsection  
| (a) is not eligible for a disbursement from the fund, unless the  
| obligation is for an improvement or fixture for a publicly owned  
| facility. (V.A.C.S. Art. 5190.14, Sec. 5A(k) (part).)

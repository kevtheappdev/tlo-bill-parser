|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the accrual of interest on annuity and other payments  
| made to certain retirees who have resumed employment within the  
| Texas Municipal Retirement System.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 852.108(f) and (j), Government Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (f) Monthly payments of a suspended annuity shall be resumed  
| in the month following the month in which employment is terminated  
| with the reemploying municipality _and recomputed to reflect the_  
| _accumulation of interest_ , [ ~~without change in the amount except for~~ ]  
| any increase allowed under Section 854.203 _, and_ [ ~~or~~ ] the duration  
| of or another condition pertaining to the suspended benefit. Except  
| as provided by Subsection (j), payment of the resumed benefit may  
| not be made for any month during which the payment was suspended  
| under this section.  
|  (j) A person to whom this section applies shall receive a  
| lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the sum of the service  
| retirement annuity payments the person would have received had the  
| person's annuity payments not been discontinued and suspended under  
| this section _, plus accumulated interest,_ if the person:  
|  (1) initially retired based on a bona fide termination  
| of employment; and  
|  (2) resumed employment with the person's reemploying  
| municipality at least eight years after the effective date of the  
| person's retirement.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a member of the Texas Municipal Retirement System who terminates  
| employment with the person's reemploying municipality and files an  
| application for resumption of retirement with the board of trustees  
| of the Texas Municipal Retirement System under Section 852.108,  
| Government Code, as amended by this Act, on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. A member who terminates employment with the  
| person's reemploying municipality and files an application for  
| resumption of retirement with the board under Section 852.108,  
| Government Code, before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law as it existed immediately before that date, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

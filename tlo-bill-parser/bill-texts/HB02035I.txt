|  _(2) shall:_  
|  _(A)_ _____define "allowable costs"_ ___for purposes of this_  
| _section; and_

| _to a rural hospital is subject to any applicable adjustments made by_  
| _the commission for payments to or penalties imposed on the rural_  
| _hospital that are based on a quality-based or performance-based_  
| _requirement under the Medicaid managed care program._  
|  _(c)_ _____Not later than January 1 of each even-numbered year,_  
| _the commission shall, as applicable:_  
|  _(1)_ _____make an initial determination of the allowable_  
| _costs incurred by a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid_  
| _managed care program that is based on the rural hospital's cost_  
| _reports submitted to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services and other available information that the commission_  
| _considers relevant in determining the hospital's allowable costs;_  
| _or_  
|  _(2)_ _____review and update the allowable costs previously_  
| _determined or updated under this subsection using the same criteria_  
| _required under Subdivision (1)._  
|  SECTION 2. Not later than January 1, 2020, the Health and  
| Human Services Commission shall determine the allowable costs  
| incurred by a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid managed  
| care program before that date as required by Section  
| 533.0041(c)(1), Government Code, as added by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  _Sec._ ___28A.154._ _____RECLAMATION REQUIREMENTS. (a)_ ___A reclamation_  
| _plan must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____specify which parts of the aggregate production_  
| _operation will be reclaimed for forest, pasture, crop,_  
| _horticultural, homesite, recreational, industrial, or other uses,_  
| _including use by wildlife for food, shelter, or ground cover;_  
|  _(2)_ _____require any ridge or peak of overburden created by_  
| _surface mining to be graded to a rolling topography traversable by_  
| _machines and equipment customarily used in connection with the use_  
| _to be made of the land after reclamation, except that:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the slope of a ridge or peak of overburden is_  
| _not required to be reduced to a grade less than the original grade_  
| _of the area before mining; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the slope of the ridge of overburden_  
| _resulting from a box cut is not required to be reduced to less than_  
| _25 degrees from the horizontal;_  
|  _(3)_ _____if the extraction activities have exposed the face_  
| _of a mineral seam in which significant concentrations of_  
| _acid-forming materials are present, require the operator to cover_  
| _the exposed face of the seam:_  
|  _(A)_ _____to a depth of not less than three feet with_  
| _earth that will support plant life; or_  
|  _(B) with a permanent water impoundment;_  
|  _(4)_ _____require the operator to grade down the bank of any_  
| _pit or depression created by the removal of aggregates by surface_  
| _mining to a degree of slope determined in accordance with_  
| _commission rules, taking into consideration:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the natural topography of the land affected_  
| _by the extraction activities and of the adjacent land;_  
|  _(B) the composition of the bank; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____the most beneficial use of the pit or_  
| _depression after reclamation;_  
|  _(5)_ _____require that all land affected by the extraction_  
| _activities, except land that is to be covered with water or used for_  
| _homesite or industrial purposes, be revegetated by the planting of_  
| _seeds, trees, shrubs, or other plantings that are appropriate to_  
| _the use to be made of the land after reclamation as determined by_  
| _the operator; and_  
|  _(6)_ _____require that all mining equipment, including_  
| _dredges, drag lines, crushers, screens, conveyors, on-site mining_  
| _vehicles, haul trucks, and loaders, be removed from the site._  
|  _(b)_ _____Subsection (a)(2) does not apply to a surface mining_  
| _operation conducted in an area that is in the floodplain of a river_  
| _or stream and is subject to periodic flooding._  
|  _(c)_ _____A reclamation plan may allow an operator to construct an_  
| _earthen dam for the purpose of forming a lake in a pit that results_  
| _from surface mining operations if the formation of the lake does_  
| _not:_  
|  _(1) interfere with another mining operation; or_  
|  _(2) damage the property of another person._  
|  _(d)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a)(4), if the pit or_  
| _depression created by the removal of aggregates by surface mining_  
| _is deeper than 10 feet, the reclamation plan may allow the operator_  
| _to bench the highwall as long as the benches do not exceed 10 feet in_  
| _height._  
|  _(e)_ _____The commission by rule may prescribe the required_  
| _density of planting for purposes of Subsection (a)(5) and, if the_  
| _operator elects to reclaim in stages different parts of the_  
| _aggregate production operation as extraction activities on those_  
| _parts cease, may require replanting of those parts as necessary_  
| _before planting of the entire operation is completed._  
|  _(f)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsections (a)(5) and (e), planting is_  
| _not required on land affected by extraction activities at an_  
| _aggregate production operation if the chemical and physical_  
| _characteristics of the soil of the land are so toxic or deficient in_  
| _plant nutrients, or the soil of the land is composed of sand,_  
| _gravel, shale, or stone to such an extent, as to seriously inhibit_  
| _plant growth._  
|  _(g)_ _____Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, an_  
| _operator must complete all required grading not later than six_  
| _months after extraction activities at the aggregate production_  
| _operation cease. If the operator is unable to complete the required_  
| _grading by the deadline because of weather conditions, the_  
| _commission shall grant the operator an extension of time until_  
| _weather conditions permit completion of the required grading._  
|  _(h)_ _____Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, an_  
| _operator must begin planting seeds, trees, shrubs, or other_  
| _plantings on the land affected by extraction activities at the_  
| _aggregate production operation at the first appropriate time after_  
| _completion of the required grading. If the operator is unable to_  
| _acquire sufficient planting stock of appropriate species from local_  
| _nurseries or to acquire sufficient stock from other sources at_  
| _comparable prices, the commission shall grant the operator an_  
| _extension of time until sufficient stock at such prices is_  
| _available to plant the land in accordance with the reclamation_  
| _plan._  
|  _Sec._ ___28A.155._ _____PERFORMANCE BOND. (a)_ ___A performance bond_  
| _must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____be payable to this state and conditioned on the_  
| _faithful performance of the requirements of this subchapter and the_  
| _reclamation plan;_

| _plan._  
|  _(d)_ _____The commission shall declare a performance bond_  
| _forfeited if the operator fails to comply with the requirements of_  
| _this subchapter or the reclamation plan._  
|  _Sec._ ___28A.156._ _____INSPECTION BY COMMISSION. The commission may_  
| _periodically inspect an aggregate production operation after_  
| _extraction activities at the operation have ceased to verify that_  
| _the operator is complying with the requirements of this subchapter_  
| _and the reclamation plan._  
|  _Sec._ ___28A.157._ _____NOTICE OF COMPLETION OF RECLAMATION;_  
| _INSPECTION AND DETERMINATION BY COMMISSION. (a)_ ___After reclamation_  
| _activities at an aggregate production operation have been_

| _plan, the operator shall notify the commission in writing that the_  
| _activities have been completed._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission shall inspect the aggregate production_  
| _operation to determine whether the operator has completed_  
| _reclamation of the operation as required by this subchapter and the_  
| _reclamation plan. If the commission determines that the_  
| _reclamation of the aggregate production operation has been_  
| _completed as required by this subchapter and the reclamation plan:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the commission shall release any remaining part of_  
| _the performance bond; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the requirements of this subchapter are no longer_  
| _applicable to the operation._  
|  _Sec._ ___28A.158._ _____WAIVER BY MUNICIPALITY OF RECLAMATION_  
| _REQUIREMENTS. (a)_ ___If the reclamation activities required by a_  
| _reclamation plan conflict with a potential reasonable future use of_

| _activities at the operation, the responsible party may submit a_  
| _proposal to the governing body of the municipality inside the_  
| _boundaries or extraterritorial jurisdiction of which the operation_  
| _is located to amend the plan._  
|  _(b)_ _____The governing body of the municipality shall approve the_  
| _proposed amendment to the reclamation plan if, after a public_  
| _meeting on the proposal, the governing body determines that the_  
| _proposed amendment appears to be in the best interest of the_  
| _municipality, the county in which the aggregate production_  
| _operation is located, and this state._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the governing body of the municipality approves the_  
| _proposed amendment to the reclamation plan, the governing body_

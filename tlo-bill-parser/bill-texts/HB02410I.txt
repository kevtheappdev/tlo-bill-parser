|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a request for a nursing peer review determination.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 303.005, Occupations Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (d) and adding Subsection (b-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) _Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), if_ [ ~~If~~ ] a person  
| who is required to establish a nursing peer review committee under  
| Section 303.0015 requests a nurse to engage in conduct that the  
| nurse believes violates a nurse's duty to a patient, the nurse may  
| request, on a form developed or approved by the board, a  
| determination by a nursing peer review committee under this chapter  
| of whether the conduct violates a nurse's duty to a patient.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____If a nurse is unable to complete the form required by_  
| _Subsection (b) due to immediate patient care needs, the nurse may_  
| _orally request a determination by notifying the nurse's supervisor._  
| _The nurse must submit the form required by Subsection (b) before_  
| _leaving the practice site._  
|  (d) If a nurse requests a peer review determination under  
| Subsection (b) _or (b-1)_ and refuses to engage in the requested  
| conduct pending the peer review, the determination of the peer  
| review committee shall be considered in any decision by the nurse's  
| employer to discipline the nurse for the refusal to engage in the  
| requested conduct, but the determination is not binding if a nurse  
| administrator believes in good faith that the peer review committee  
| has incorrectly determined a nurse's duty. This subsection does  
| not affect the protections provided by Subsection (c)(1) or Section  
| 301.352.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| conduct that occurs on or after the effective date of this Act.

| governed by the law in effect on the date the conduct occurs, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

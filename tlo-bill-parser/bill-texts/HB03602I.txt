|  AN ACT  
| relating to domestic corporations and other domestic entities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 6.252, Business Organizations Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (a), (b), and (c) and adding  
| Subsections (c-1), (c-2), (c-3), (c-4), and (g) to read as follows:  
|  (a) Except as provided by this code or the governing  
| documents, any number of owners of a domestic entity, or any number  
| of owners of the domestic entity and the domestic entity itself, may  
| enter into a written voting agreement _that is not set forth in the_  
| _entity's governing documents_ to provide the manner of voting of the  
| ownership interests of the domestic entity. A voting agreement  
| entered into under this subsection is not part of the governing  
| documents of the domestic entity.  
|  (b) A copy of a voting agreement entered into under  
| Subsection (a):  
|  (1) _may_ [ ~~shall~~ ] be deposited with the domestic entity  
| at the domestic entity's principal executive office or registered  
| office; and  
|  (2) _if deposited as provided by Subdivision (1),_ is  
| subject to examination by an owner, whether in person or by the  
| owner's agent or attorney, in the same manner as the owner is  
| entitled to examine the books and records of the domestic entity.  
|  (c) A voting agreement entered into under Subsection (a) is  
| specifically enforceable against the _owner_ [ ~~holder~~ ] of an ownership  
| interest that is the subject of the agreement _if the owner executes_  
| _the voting agreement or acknowledges in writing that the owner or_  
| _the ownership interest is bound by the agreement_ [ ~~, and any~~  
|  ~~successor or transferee of the holder, if:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the voting agreement is noted conspicuously on~~  
|  ~~the certificate representing the ownership interests; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~a notation of the voting agreement is contained~~  
|  ~~in a notice sent by or on behalf of the domestic entity in~~  
|  ~~accordance with Section 3.205, if the ownership interest is not~~  
|  ~~represented by a certificate~~ ].  
|  _(c-1)_ _____A voting agreement entered into under Subsection (a)_  
| _is specifically enforceable against any subsequent owner of the_  
| _ownership interest subject to the voting agreement if the_  
| _subsequent owner:_  
|  _(1)_ _____has notice or actual knowledge of the voting_  
| _agreement at or before the time of transfer to the subsequent owner;_  
|  _(2)_ _____is not a transferee for value and receives notice_  
| _or obtains actual knowledge of the voting agreement; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____acknowledges in writing that the subsequent owner_  
| _or the ownership interest is bound by the voting agreement._  
|  _(c-2)_ _____A subsequent owner is considered to have notice of a_  
| _voting agreement for purposes of Subsection (c-1)(1) if, at the_  
| _time of transfer, the existence of the voting agreement is noted_  
| _conspicuously on any certificate representing the ownership_  
| _interest held by the transferor owner. The notice described by this_  
| _subsection is not the exclusive method by which notice of the voting_  
| _agreement may be received by a subsequent owner for purposes of_  
| _Subsection (c-1)(1)._  
|  _(c-3)_ _____A voting agreement that becomes specifically_  
| _enforceable against a subsequent owner under Subsection (c-1)(2) is_  
| _specifically enforceable from the time the subsequent owner first_  
| _receives notice or obtains actual knowledge of the voting_  
| _agreement._  
|  _(c-4)_ _____A voting agreement that becomes specifically_  
| _enforceable against a subsequent owner under Subsection (c-1)(3) is_  
| _specifically enforceable from the time of the written_  
| _acknowledgment by the subsequent owner._  
|  _(g)_ _____This section does not impair the right of the domestic_  
| _entity to treat an owner of record as entitled to vote the ownership_  
| _interest standing in the owner's name or to accept that owner's vote_  
| _of the ownership interest._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 10.354(b) and (c), Business  
| Organizations Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), subject to Subsection  
| (c), an owner may not dissent from a plan of merger or conversion in

| respect of the ownership interest, held by the owner _:_  
|  _(A)_ is part of a class or series of ownership  
| interests, or depository receipts in respect of ownership

| determining which owners are entitled to vote on the plan of merger _,_  
| _other than a merger pursuant to Section 21.459(c)_ , conversion, or  
| exchange, as appropriate _, are either_ :

| _directly or indirectly, approves the plan of merger, are either:_  
|  _(i)_ _____listed on a national securities_  
| _exchange; or_

|  (2) the owner is not required by the terms of the plan  
| of merger, conversion, or exchange, as appropriate, to accept for  
| the owner's ownership interest any consideration that is different  
| from the consideration to be provided to any other holder of an  
| ownership interest of the same class or series as the ownership  
| interest held by the owner, other than cash instead of fractional  
| shares or interests the owner would otherwise be entitled to  
| receive; and  
|  (3) the owner is not required by the terms of the plan  
| of merger, conversion, or exchange, as appropriate, to accept for  
| the owner's ownership interest any consideration other than:  
|  (A) ownership interests, or depository receipts  
| in respect of ownership interests, of a domestic entity or non-code  
| organization of the same general organizational type that,  
| immediately after the effective date of the merger, conversion, or  
| exchange, as appropriate, will be part of a class or series of

| exchange or authorized for listing on the exchange on official

|  (C) any combination of the ownership interests _,_  
| _or fractional depository receipts in respect of ownership_  
| _interests,_ and cash described by Paragraphs (A) and (B).  
|  (c) Subsection (b) shall not apply [ ~~either~~ ] to a domestic  
| entity that is a subsidiary with respect to a merger under Section  
| 10.006 [ ~~or to a corporation with respect to a merger under Section~~  
|  ~~21.459(c)~~ ].

| _poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily_  
| _function unless the abortion is performed; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the actor performs or attempts to perform the_  
| _abortion in a manner that, in the actor's reasonable medical_  
| _judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to_  
| _survive unless, in the actor's reasonable medical judgment, that_  
| _manner would create:_  
|  _(A)_ _____a greater risk of the pregnant female's_  
| _death; or_

| _death or in substantial impairment of a major bodily function._  
|  _(e)_ _____It is an exception to the application of this section_

| _recovery._  
|  _Sec._ ___50.04._ _____CIVIL REMEDIES UNAFFECTED. The fact that_

| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

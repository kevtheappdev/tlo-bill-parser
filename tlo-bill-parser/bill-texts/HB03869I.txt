| personal property held for sale at retail.

| 23.124, _23.1241, 23.1244,_ and 23.127, the market value of an  
| inventory is the price for which it would sell as a unit to a  
| purchaser who would continue the business. An inventory shall  
| include residential real property which has never been occupied as  
| a residence and is held for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or  
| business, provided that the residential real property remains  
| unoccupied, is not leased or rented, and produces no income.  
|  (f) The owner of an inventory other than a dealer's motor  
| vehicle inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.121, [ ~~a~~  
|  ~~dealer's heavy equipment inventory as that term is defined by~~  
|  ~~Section 23.1241, or~~ ] a dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory  
| as that term is defined by Section 23.124, _a dealer's heavy_  
| _equipment inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.1241, a_  
| _retail inventory as that term is defined by Section 23.1244,_ or a  
| retail manufactured housing inventory as that term is defined by  
| Section 23.127 may elect to have the inventory appraised at its  
| market value as of September 1 of the year preceding the tax year to  
| which the appraisal applies by filing an application with the chief  
| appraiser requesting that the inventory be appraised as of  
| September 1. The application must clearly describe the inventory  
| to which it applies and be signed by the owner of the inventory. The  
| application applies to the appraisal of the inventory in each tax  
| year that begins after the next August 1 following the date the  
| application is filed with the chief appraiser unless the owner of  
| the inventory by written notice filed with the chief appraiser  
| revokes the application or the ownership of the inventory changes.  
| A notice revoking the application is effective for each tax year  
| that begins after the next September following the date the notice  
| of revocation is filed with the chief appraiser.

| _inventory on January 1._  
|  _(f)_ _____The comptroller by rule shall adopt a retailer's retail_

| _the chief appraiser may examine:_  
|  _(1)_ _____documentation appropriate to allow the chief_  
| _appraiser to ascertain the applicability of this section to the_  
| _person; and_

| _forth in the declaration filed by the retailer._  
|  _(h)_ _____A retailer who fails to timely file a declaration under_  
| _Subsection (f) in a tax year waives any right to have the retailer's_  
| _retail inventory appraised as provided by this section in that tax_  
| _year._  
|  _(i)_ _____Section 23.123 applies to a declaration filed under this_  
| _section in the same manner in which that section applies to a_

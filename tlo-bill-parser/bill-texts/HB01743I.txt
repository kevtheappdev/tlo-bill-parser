|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the additional ad valorem tax and interest imposed as a  
| result of a change of use of certain land.

|  SECTION 1. Section 23.55(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by  
| this subchapter changes, an additional tax is imposed on the land  
| equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the land for  
| each of the _three_ [ ~~five~~ ] years preceding the year in which the  
| change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this  
| subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the land  
| been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years, plus  
| interest at an annual rate of _five_ [ ~~seven~~ ] percent calculated from  
| the dates on which the differences would have become due. For  
| purposes of this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider  
| any period during which land is owned by the state in determining  
| whether a change in the use of the land has occurred.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 23.76(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by  
| this subchapter changes, an additional tax is imposed on the land  
| equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the land for  
| each of the _three_ [ ~~five~~ ] years preceding the year in which the  
| change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this  
| subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the land  
| been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years, plus  
| interest at an annual rate of _five_ [ ~~seven~~ ] percent calculated from  
| the dates on which the differences would have become due.  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a change of use of land appraised under Subchapter D or E, Chapter  
| 23, Tax Code, that occurs on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A change in the use of land appraised under Subchapter D or E,  
| Chapter 23, Tax Code, that occurs before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the change of use  
| occurred, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

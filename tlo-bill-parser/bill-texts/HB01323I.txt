|  _(c)_ _____In each criminal case, there is a rebuttable presumption_  
| _that monetary bail, conditions of release, or both monetary bail_  
| _and conditions of release are sufficient to reasonably ensure the_  
| _defendant's appearance in court as required and the safety of the_  
| _community and the victim of the alleged offense. For purposes of_

| _costs or order the costs to be paid directly by the defendant as a_  
| _condition of release._  
|  _(g)_ _____A judge may not adopt a bail schedule or enter a standing_  
| _order related to bail that:_

| _writing the defendant's right to a bail review hearing. The court_

| _hearing. A waiver under this subsection shall be filed with and_

| _review hearing concludes and before the trial of the offense_  
| _commences, and regardless of whether the defendant was released or_  
| _confined as a result of that hearing, the court may reopen the bail_  
| _review hearing based on new information that the court determines_

| the court, judge, magistrate _,_ or officer taking the bail _and is_ [ ~~;~~  
|  ~~they are to be~~ ] governed [ ~~in the exercise of this discretion~~ ] by

| _defendant's criminal history, including any prior offenses_

| recommendation of a personal bond office, the court shall assess a  
| personal bond fee of $20 or three percent of the amount of the bail  
| fixed for the _defendant_ [ ~~accused~~ ], whichever is greater.  The court  
| may waive the fee or assess a lesser fee if _the court determines_  
| _that the defendant is indigent or demonstrates an inability to pay_  
| _the fee or if other_ good cause is shown.  A court that requires a  
| defendant to give a personal bond under Article 45.016 may not

| amended by this Act, applies only to a justice of the peace who is  
| first elected or appointed on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A justice of the peace who is first elected or appointed  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect on the date the justice was first elected or appointed, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  (b) A justice of the peace serving on the effective date of  
| this Act must complete the justice's initial two hours of

| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and the former  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 15. (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) of  
| this section, this Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

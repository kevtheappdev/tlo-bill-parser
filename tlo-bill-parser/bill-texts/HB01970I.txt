|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the additional tax imposed on land appraised for ad  
| valorem tax purposes as qualified open-space land if a change in use  
| of the land occurs.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.55(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by  
| this subchapter changes, an additional tax is imposed on the land  
| equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the land for  
| each of the _two_ [ ~~five~~ ] years preceding the year in which the change  
| of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this  
| subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the land  
| been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years, plus  
| interest at an annual rate of seven percent calculated from the  
| dates on which the differences would have become due. For purposes  
| of this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider any period  
| during which land is owned by the state in determining whether a  
| change in the use of the land has occurred.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a change in the use of land appraised under Subchapter D, Chapter  
| 23, Tax Code, that occurs on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A change in the use of land appraised under Subchapter D,  
| Chapter 23, Tax Code, that occurred before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the change in  
| use occurred, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

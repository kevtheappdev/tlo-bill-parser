| restriction on the ratio of building floor space to the land square  
| footage;

| per acre of land; or  
|  (5) the size, type, or method of construction of a

| developed tract of land if:  
|  (A) the facility meets the minimum standards  
| established for water or wastewater facilities by state and federal  
| regulatory entities; and  
|  (B) the developed tract of land is:  
|  (i) located in a county with a population of  
| 2.8 million or more; and

| constructed before September 1, 2001, that fail to provide adequate  
| services; or  
|  (b) on-site water wells constructed  
| before September 1, 2001, that fail to provide an adequate supply of  
| safe drinking water.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| receipt.  
|  (c) The commissioner may enter an order denying

| registration statement if after the examination the commissioner  
| determines that the registrant has not proven that:  
|  (1) the proposed plan of business of the issuer of the  
| securities is fair, just, and equitable;  
|  (2) any consideration paid or to be paid by promoters  
| for the securities is fair, just, and equitable if that  
| consideration is less than the proposed offering price to the  
| public; and  
|  (3) the securities the registrant proposes to issue  
| and the methods to be used by the registrant in issuing and  
| disposing of the securities will not work a fraud upon the purchaser  
| of the securities.  
|  (d) If the commissioner enters an order denying the  
| registration of securities under this subchapter, the commissioner  
| shall notify the registrant immediately.  
|  (e) A registration statement under this subchapter becomes  
| effective automatically at the moment the federal registration  
| statement becomes effective if all of the following conditions are  
| satisfied:  
|  (1) the commissioner has not entered an order denying  
| registration of the securities;  
|  (2) the registration statement has been on file with  
| the commissioner for at least 10 days; and  
|  (3) a statement of the maximum and minimum proposed  
| offering prices and the maximum underwriting discounts and  
| commissions has been on file for two full business days or a shorter  
| period as the commissioner expressly permits and the offering is  
| made within those limitations.  
|  (f) The commissioner may waive either or both of the  
| conditions specified in Subsections (e)(2) and (3).  
|  (g) The registrant shall promptly:  
|  (1) notify the commissioner by telephone or telegram  
| of the date and time when the federal registration statement became  
| effective and the content of any price amendment; and  
|  (2) file a post-effective amendment containing the  
| information and documents in the price amendment.  
|  (h) The commissioner may enter a stop order, without notice  
| or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to or suspending  
| effectiveness of the registration statement until the registrant  
| complies with this subchapter if the commissioner:  
|  (1) does not receive the notification and  
| post-effective amendment required under Subsection (g); and  
|  (2) promptly notifies the registrant by telephone or  
| telegram of the issuance of the stop order, and promptly confirms by  
| letter or telegram if the commissioner notifies by telephone.  
|  (i) A stop order entered under Subsection (h) is void from  
| the time of the order's entry if the registrant proves compliance  
| with the notice and post-effective amendment requirements of this  
| section.  
|  (j) If the federal registration statement becomes effective  
| before all conditions under this section are satisfied and the  
| conditions are not waived, the registration statement becomes  
| effective automatically when all the conditions are satisfied.  
|  (k) If the registrant advises the commissioner of the date  
| the federal registration statement is expected to become effective,  
| the commissioner shall promptly advise the registrant by telephone  
| or telegram, at the registrant's expense, whether all the  
| conditions are satisfied and whether the commissioner then

|  (b) The commissioner may hold a hearing under this section

|  (b) The commissioner may request the attorney general to  
| bring an action as provided by this section for the appointment of a

| company or the person's or company's assets on the attorney  
| general's proper showing of the existence of the facts described by

| the receiver's duties in the particular case.  
|  (i) The commissioner or attorney general may not be required  
| to give a bond for receivership in an action brought under this  
| section. The court shall require a person appointed as a receiver  
| to give a bond that is:  
|  (1) in an amount found by the court to be sufficient  
| after considering the probable nature and magnitude of the  
| receiver's duties in the particular case; and  
|  (2) conditioned on the faithful discharge of the  
| receiver's duties.  
|  (j) The remedy provided by this section is in addition to  
| any other remedy made available to the commissioner or the attorney  
| general by statutory laws or case law of this state, including any

| fraud or a fraudulent practice in connection with the sale of a  
| security;  
|  (2) has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in  
| fraud or a fraudulent practice in rendering services as an  
| investment adviser or investment adviser representative;  
|  (3) has made an offer containing a statement that is  
| materially misleading or is otherwise likely to deceive the public;  
| or  
|  (4) has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in  
| an act or practice that violates this title or a board rule or  
| order.

| (a);  
|  (B) any person who, with intent to deceive or  
| defraud or with reckless disregard for the truth or the law, has

| manner participating in or about to participate in the acts or  
| practices described by Subsection (a); and

| relief must be verified by the commissioner on information and  
| belief.

| concerning the acts, conduct, or other matters complained about in  
| the application for injunctive relief; and  
|  (2) the production of documents, books, and records  
| that may be necessary for the hearing on the action.  
|  (e) A district court in any county in which it is shown that  
| the acts that are the subject of the application for injunctive  
| relief have been or are about to be committed or a district court in  
| Travis County has jurisdiction and venue of an action brought under  
| this section. This subsection is superior to any provision  
| establishing jurisdiction or venue with regard to an action for an  
| injunction.

| required to give a bond for injunction in an action brought under  
| this section. (V.A.C.S. Art. 581-32, Subsec. A.)

| provides the commissioner or the attorney general with a remedy,  
| the amount of money or the property the defendant obtained from the  
| victim, including any bonus, fee, commission, option, proceeds, or  
| profit from or loss avoided through the sale of the security or  
| through the rendering of services as an investment adviser or  
| investment adviser representative, or any other tangible benefit.

|  Sec. 4007.154. CIVIL PENALTY. (a) On the commissioner's

| victim's ~~past~~ sexual ~~behavior~~ _predisposition_.  
|  (b) Exceptions ~~for Specific Instances. Evidence of~~  
|  ~~specific instances of a victim's past sexual behavior is admissible~~

|  (1) ~~the court admits the evidence in accordance with~~  
|  ~~subdivisions (c) and (d); (1)~~ _Criminal Cases. The court may admit_  
| _the following evidence in a criminal case:_

| _defendant's constitutional rights._  
|  (2) ~~the evidence:~~ _Civil Cases. In a civil case, the_  
| _court may admit evidence offered to prove a victim's sexual_  
| _behavior or sexual predisposition if its probative value_  
| _substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of_

|  ~~evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior, the defendant must~~  
|  ~~inform the court outside the jury's presence. The court must then~~  
|  ~~conduct an in camera hearing, recorded by a court reporter, and~~  
|  ~~determine whether the proposed evidence is admissible. The~~  
|  ~~defendant may not refer to any evidence ruled inadmissible without~~  
|  ~~first requesting and gaining the court's approval outside the~~  
|  ~~jury's presence.~~ _To Determine Admissibility_

| _rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the_  
| _victim and parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court_  
| _orders otherwise, the motion, related materials, and the record of_  
| _the hearing must be and remain sealed._  
|  (d) ~~Record Sealed. The court must preserve the record of~~  
|  ~~the in camera hearing, under seal, as part of the record.~~

|  (b) Disclosure to the Defendant. If the prosecutor intends  
| to offer this evidence, the prosecutor must disclose it to the  
| defendant, including witnesses' statements or a summary of the

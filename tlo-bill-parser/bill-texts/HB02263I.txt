| adjustment must be made effective at the same time as the decrease  
| of tax liability or as soon after that decrease occurs as is

| Utilities Code, that accounts for any decrease in the utility's tax  
| liability attributable to the exemption in Section 182.022(d), Tax  
| Code, as added by this Act. An adjustment is not a rate case under  
| Subchapter C or D, Chapter 36, Utilities Code.

| electric provider, as defined by Section 31.002, Utilities Code,

| reflect any decrease in the retail electric provider's tax  
| liability to this state if the decrease is attributable to the  
| exemption in Section 182.022(d), Tax Code, as added by this Act. An  
| adjustment must be made effective at the same time as the decrease  
| of tax liability or as soon after that decrease occurs as is  
| reasonably practicable.  
|  SECTION 11. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b) of  
| this section, this Act takes effect immediately if it receives a  
| vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.  
|  (b) Section 182.022(d), Tax Code, as added by this Act,  
| takes effect January 1, 2024.

| resolution may provide, declare the principal of all of such bonds  
| due and payable, and if all defaults shall have been made good, then  
| with the written consent of the holders of twenty-five (25) per  
| centum in aggregate principal amount of such bonds at the time  
| outstanding, annul such declaration and its consequences;

| outstanding shall _by_ [ ~~be~~ ] instrument or instruments in writing  
| delivered to such trustee have the right to direct and control any  
| and all action taken or to be taken by such trustee under this  
| paragraph. Any such resolution, indenture or agreement may provide  
| that in any such suit, action, or proceeding, any such trustee,  
| whether or not all of such bonds shall have been declared due and  
| payable, and with or without possession of any thereof, shall be  
| entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter  
| and take possession of all or any part of the properties of the  
| District, and operate and maintain the same, and fix, collect, and  
| receive rates and charges sufficient to provide revenues adequate  
| to pay the items set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and  
| (e) of Section 9 hereof and the costs and disbursements of such  
| suit, action or proceeding, and to apply such revenues in  
| conformity with the provisions of this Act and the resolution or  
| resolutions authorizing such bonds. In any suit, action or  
| proceeding by any such trustee, the reasonable fees, counsel fees  
| and expenses of such trustee and of the receiver or receivers, if  
| any, shall constitute taxable disbursements and all costs and  
| disbursements allowed by the Court shall be a first charge upon any  
| revenues pledged to secure the payment of such bonds. Subject to  
| the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Texas, the courts  
| of the County of Comal shall have jurisdiction of any suit, action  
| or proceeding by any such trustee on behalf of the bondholders and  
| of all property involved therein. In addition to the powers  
| hereinabove specifically provided for, each such trustee shall have  
| and possess all powers necessary or _appropriate_ [ ~~appropriated~~ ] for  
| the exercise of any thereof, or incident to the general  
| representation of the bondholders in the enforcement of their  
| rights.

| District is authorized to make and issue interim bonds. The interim  
| bonds so issued will be taken up with the proceeds of the definitive  
| bonds, or the definitive bonds may be issued and delivered in  
| exchange for and in substitution of such interim bonds. After any  
| such exchange and substitution the District shall file proper  
| certificates with the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State  
| of Texas as to such exchange, substitution and cancellation, and  
| such certificates shall be recorded by the Comptroller of Public  
| Accounts in the same manner as the record of proceedings  
| authorizing the issuance of the bonds. The District is also  
| authorized to make and issue temporary bonds for the purpose of  
| interim financing and to make agreements or other provision to  
| refinance such temporary bonds with bonds to provide permanent  
| financing at such time, in such manner and on such conditions as may  
| be determined by the Board.  
|  (4) Before any bonds shall be sold by the District, a  
| certified copy of the proceedings for the issuance thereof,  
| including the form of such bonds, together with any other  
| information which the Attorney General of the State of Texas may  
| require, shall be submitted to the Attorney General, and if he shall  
| find that such bonds have been issued in accordance with law, and if  
| he shall approve such bonds, he shall execute a certificate to that  
| effect which shall be filed in the office of the Comptroller of the  
| State of Texas and be recorded in a record kept for that purpose. No  
| bonds shall be issued until the same shall have been registered by  
| the Comptroller, who shall so register the same if the Attorney  
| General shall have filed with the Comptroller his certificate  
| approving the bonds and the proceedings for the issuance thereof as  
| hereinabove provided.  
|  (5) All bonds approved by the Attorney General as  
| aforesaid, and registered by the Comptroller as aforesaid, and  
| issued in accordance with the proceedings so approved shall be  
| valid and binding obligations of the District and shall be  
| incontestable for any cause from and after the time of such  
| registration.  
|  (6) If any bonds recite that they are secured by a  
| pledge of the proceeds of a contract, lease, sale or other agreement  
| (herein called 'contract'), a copy of such contract and the  
| proceedings of the contracting parties will also be submitted to  
| the Attorney General. If such bonds have been authorized and such  
| contracts made in compliance with law, the Attorney General shall  
| approve the bonds and contracts, and the bonds shall then be  
| registered by the Comptroller of Public Accounts. When so  
| approved, such bonds and the contracts shall be valid and binding  
| and shall be incontestable for any cause from and after the time of  
| such registration.  
|  (7) The District is authorized to make and issue bonds  
| or notes (herein called 'refunding bonds') for the purpose of  
| refunding or refinancing any outstanding bonds or notes authorized  
| and issued by the District pursuant to this Act or other law (herein  
| called 'bonds') and the interest and premium, if any, thereon to  
| maturity or on any earlier redemption date specified in the  
| resolution authorizing the issuance of the refunding bonds. Such  
| refunding bonds may be issued to refund more than one series of  
| outstanding bonds, may combine the pledges of the outstanding bonds  
| for the security of the refunding bonds or may be secured by other  
| or additional revenues. All provisions of this Act with reference  
| to the issuance of bonds, the terms and provisions thereof, their  
| approval by the Attorney General, and the remedies of the  
| bondholders shall be applicable to refunding bonds. Refunding  
| bonds shall be registered by the Comptroller upon surrender and  
| cancellation of the bonds to be refunded, but in lieu thereof, the  
| resolution authorizing the issuance of refunding bonds may provide  
| that they shall be sold and the proceeds thereof deposited at the  
| places at which the original bonds are payable, in which case the  
| refunding bonds may be issued in an amount sufficient to pay the  
| interest and premium, if any, on the original bonds to their  
| maturity date or specified earlier redemption date, and the  
| Comptroller will register them without concurrence, surrender and  
| cancellation of the original bonds. The District may also refund  
| any outstanding bonds in the manner provided by any applicable  
| General Law.

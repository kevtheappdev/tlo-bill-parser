| [ ~~PEACE~~ ] OFFICERS.  (a)  _This section applies only to a member who_  
| _participates in the law enforcement, custodial, and peace officer_  
| _supplemental retirement fund._  
|  _(a-1)_ A member who has at least 20 years of service credit as  
| a law enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_  
| officer is eligible to retire regardless of age and receive a  
| standard service retirement annuity in an amount and to be funded as

|  (b) The standard service retirement annuity payable for at  
| least 20 years of service credit as a law enforcement _, juvenile_  
| _justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer is an amount computed
on  
| the basis of the member's average monthly compensation for the 60  
| highest months of compensation in the employee class, times the sum  
| of the percentage factor used in the computation of a standard  
| service retirement annuity under Section 814.105 plus .5 percent.  
|  (c) The standard combined service retirement annuity that  
| is payable under this section is based on retirement on or after the  
| attainment of the normal retirement age, which for purposes of this  
| section is the earlier of either the age of 57 or the age at which  
| the sum of the member's age and amount of service credit in the

| enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer
who  
| retires before reaching the age of 57 under any eligibility  
| criteria is actuarially reduced by five percent for each year of  
| difference between the member's age at retirement and 57.  The  
| actuarial reduction described by this section is in addition to any  
| other actuarial reduction required by law.  
|  (c-1) A law enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _,_  
| _or peace_ officer who retires before attaining the age of 50 is  
| entitled only to an annuity that is actuarially reduced from the  
| annuity available at the age of 50 to the law enforcement _, juvenile_  
| _justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer whose service credit  
| annuity amount is based on the sum of the member's age and amount of  
| law enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_
officer  
| service credit and employee class service credit, and is not  
| entitled to have the annuity recalculated at normal retirement age.  
| The standard or reduced annuity under this section is payable from  
| the trust fund established by Section 815.310 and the law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] custodial _, and peace_ officer supplemental  
| retirement fund in a ratio determined by the retirement system.  
|  (d) A member who retires under this section retires  
| simultaneously from the employee class of membership. Optional  
| retirement annuities provided by Section 814.108 are available to a  
| member eligible to receive a service retirement annuity under this  
| section, but the same optional plan and beneficiary must be  
| selected for the portion of the annuity payable from the law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] custodial _, and peace_ officer supplemental  
| retirement fund and the portion payable from the trust fund  
| established by Section 815.310.  
|  (e) The amount payable from the law enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ]  
| custodial _, and peace_ officer supplemental retirement fund is  
| reducible by the amount paid from the trust fund established by  
| Section 815.310 for service as a law enforcement _, juvenile justice,_  
| [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer.  The total combined amount of an  
| annuity under this section may not be less than the authorized  
| benefit under Subsection (b) subtracted by any amount necessary  
| because of selection of an optional annuity, because of retirement  
| before the normal retirement age, or as provided by Subsection (f).  
|  (f) The standard combined service retirement annuity  
| payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a law  
| enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer
may  
| not exceed 100 percent of the average compensation computed under  
| Subsection (b).  
|  (g) For purposes of this section, service as a law  
| enforcement _, juvenile justice,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer
is  
| creditable as provided by rule of the board of trustees or on a  
| month-to-month basis, whichever is greater.

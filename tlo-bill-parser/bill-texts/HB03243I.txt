|  SECTION 2. Section 11.431(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) If a late application is approved after approval of the  
| appraisal records by the appraisal review board, the chief  
| appraiser shall notify the collector for each unit in which the  
| residence is located not later than the 30th day after the date the  
| late application is approved. The collector shall deduct from the  
| person's tax bill the amount of tax imposed on the exempted amount  
| if the tax has not been paid. If the tax has been paid, the  
| collector shall refund _to the person who was the owner of the_  
| _property on the date the tax was paid_ the amount of tax imposed on  
| the exempted amount. The collector shall pay the refund not later  
| than the 60th day after the date the chief appraiser notifies the

| in which the property was taxable in that year not later than the  
| 30th day after the date the late application is approved. The  
| collector shall correct the taxing unit's tax roll to reflect the  
| amount of tax imposed on the property after applying the exemption  
| and shall deduct from the person's tax bill the amount of tax  
| imposed on the exempted portion of the property for that year. If  
| the tax and any related penalties and interest have been paid, the  
| collector shall pay to the person _who was the owner of the property_  
| _on the date the tax was paid_ a refund of the tax imposed on the  
| exempted portion of the property and the corresponding portion of  
| any related penalties and interest paid. The collector shall pay

|  (b) If an individual qualifies for an exemption under  
| Section 11.13(c) or (d), 11.133, or 11.134 with respect to the  
| property after the amount of the tax due on the property is  
| calculated and the effect of the qualification is to reduce the  
| amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor for each taxing  
| unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on the property and  
| correct the tax roll. If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax  
| on the property has not been paid, the assessor shall mail a  
| corrected tax bill to the person in whose name the property is  
| listed on the tax roll or to the person's authorized agent. If the  
| tax on the property has been paid, the tax collector for the taxing  
| unit shall refund to the person who _was the owner of the property on_  
| _the date the tax was_ paid [ ~~the tax~~ ] the amount by which the payment  
| exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 26.1125(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) If a person qualifies for an exemption under Section  
| 11.131 with respect to the property after the amount of the tax due  
| on the property is calculated and the effect of the qualification is  
| to reduce the amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor  
| for each taxing unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on  
| the property and correct the tax roll. If the tax bill has been  
| mailed and the tax on the property has not been paid, the assessor  
| shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in whose name the  
| property is listed on the tax roll or to the person's authorized  
| agent. If the tax on the property has been paid, the tax collector  
| for the taxing unit shall refund to the person who _was the owner of_  
| _the property on the date the tax was_ paid [ ~~the tax~~ ] the amount by  
| which the payment exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 26.1127(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) If an individual qualifies for an exemption under  
| Section 11.132 with respect to the property after the amount of the  
| tax due on the property is calculated and the effect of the  
| qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the  
| property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall recalculate the  
| amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll. If  
| the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been  
| paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the individual  
| in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the  
| individual's authorized agent. If the tax on the property has been  
| paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the  
| individual who _was the owner of the property on the date the tax was_  
| paid [ ~~the tax~~ ] the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 7. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a refund made on or after the effective date of this Act. A  
| refund made before the effective date of this Act is governed by the  
| law in effect on the date the refund was made, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 8. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

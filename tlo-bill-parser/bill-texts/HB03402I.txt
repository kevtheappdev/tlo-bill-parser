|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to changing the criminal offense of conspiracy to  
| circumvent the open meetings law.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1.  
| Section 551.143(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 551.143. _PROHIBITED SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS_  
| [ ~~CONSPIRACY TO CIRCUMVENT CHAPTER~~ ]; OFFENSE; PENALTY.  (a)  A  
| member [ ~~or group of members~~ ] of a governmental body commits an  
| offense if _:_  
|  _(1)_ the member [ ~~or group of members~~ ] knowingly _engages_  
| _in at least one among a series of communications that each occur_  
| _outside of an open meeting concerning any public business of the_  
| _governmental body where individual communications are among fewer_  
| _than a quorum of members; and_ [ ~~conspires to circumvent this chapter~~  
|  ~~by meeting in numbers less than a quorum for the purpose of secret~~  
|  ~~deliberations in violation of this chapter~~ ]  
|  _(2)_ _the member knew at the time the member engaged in_  
| _the series of communications that the series:_  
|  _(A)_ _involved or would involve a quorum and,_  
|  _(B)_ _would constitute a deliberation in violation_  
| _of this chapter if the series of communications had occurred in a_  
| _single instance among every member involved in the series_.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred  
| before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution.  If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

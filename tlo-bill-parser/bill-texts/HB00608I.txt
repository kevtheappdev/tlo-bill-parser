|  SECTION 1. Subchapter Z, Chapter 214, Local Government  
| Code, is amended by adding Section 214.907 to read as follows:

| _more._  
|  _(b) In this section:_  
|  _(1) "Residential building" means:_  
|  _(A)_ _____a single-family residential building leased_  
| _or rented by the owner of the building to another person; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____a multifamily residential building_  
| _containing more than one dwelling unit leased or rented by the owner_  
| _of the building to another person._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Substandard residential building" means a_  
| _residential building that is:_  
|  _(A)_ _____dilapidated or unfit for human habitation;_  
| _and_  
|  _(B)_ _____a hazard to the public health, safety, or_  
| _welfare._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Substandard residential building fine" means a_  
| _fine or penalty imposed by a municipality on the owner of a_  
| _substandard residential building under a municipal ordinance_  
| _applicable to the condition of the building._  
|  _(c)_ _____An owner of a substandard residential building is_  
| _personally liable for the payment of a substandard residential_  
| _building fine imposed for the owner's building._  
|  _(d)_ _____A municipality may file a lien on the property on which a_  
| _substandard residential building is located, and for which the_  
| _owner has received a substandard residential building fine, for the_  
| _amount of the fine. The lien arises and attaches to the property at_  
| _the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the_  
| _office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is_  
| _located. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner_  
| _if that information can be determined with reasonable effort, a_

| _balance of the fine imposed by the municipality. The lien is_  
| _extinguished if the property owner or another person having an_  
| _interest in the legal title to the property pays the fine. The lien_  
| _is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien_  
| _attached to the property to which the municipality's lien attaches_  
| _if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the office of the_  
| _county clerk of the county in which the property is located before_  
| _the date the fine was imposed by the municipality. The_  
| _municipality's lien is superior to all other previously recorded_  
| _judgment liens._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a substandard residential building fine, as defined by Section  
| 214.907, Local Government Code, as added by this Act, that is issued  
| by a municipality on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

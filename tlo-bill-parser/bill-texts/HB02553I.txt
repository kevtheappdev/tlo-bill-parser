| transaction received by the Public Utilities Commission of Texas on  
| or after the effective date of this Act.  A request for an approval  
| received by that commission before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect immediately before the effective date  
| of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  SECTION 3. Section 34.01, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a), (b), (f), and (r) and adding Subsection (r-3) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) Real _or personal_ property seized under a tax warrant  
| issued under Subchapter _B or_ E, Chapter 33, or ordered sold pursuant  
| to _a judgment for_ foreclosure of a tax lien shall be sold by the  
| officer charged with selling the property, unless otherwise  
| directed by the taxing unit that requested the warrant or order of  
| sale or by an authorized agent or attorney for that unit. The sale  
| shall be conducted in the manner similar property is sold under  
| execution except as otherwise provided by this subtitle.  
|  (b) On receipt of an order of sale of real _or personal_  
| property, the officer charged with selling the property shall  
| endorse on the order the date and exact time when the officer  
| received the order. The endorsement is a levy on the property  
| without necessity for going upon the ground. The officer shall  
| calculate the total amount due under the judgment, including all  
| taxes, penalties, and interest, plus any other amount awarded by  
| the judgment, court costs, and the costs of the sale. The costs of a  
| sale include the costs of advertising, and _any_ deed recording fees  
| anticipated to be paid in connection with the sale of the property.  
| To assist the officer in making the calculation, the collector of  
| any taxing unit that is party to the judgment may provide the  
| officer with a certified tax statement showing the amount of the  
| taxes included in the judgment that remain due that taxing unit and  
| all penalties, interest, and attorney's fees provided by the  
| judgment as of the date of the proposed sale. If a certified tax  
| statement is provided to the officer, the officer shall rely on the  
| amount included in the statement and is not responsible or liable  
| for the accuracy of the applicable portion of the calculation. A  
| certified tax statement is not required to be sworn to and is  
| sufficient if the tax collector or the collector's deputy signs the  
| statement.  
|  (f) A notice of sale _of real property_ is not required to  
| include field notes describing the property. A description of the  
| property is sufficient if the notice:  
|  (1) states the number of acres and identifies the  
| original survey;  
|  (2) as to property located in a platted subdivision or  
| addition, regardless of whether the subdivision or addition is  
| recorded, states the name by which the land is generally known with  
| reference to that subdivision or addition; or  
|  (3) by reference adopts the description of the  
| property contained in the judgment.  
|  (r) Except as provided by Subsection (a-1) and this  
| subsection, a sale of real property under this section must take  
| place at the county courthouse in the county in which the _real_  
| _property_ [ ~~land~~ ] is located.  The commissioners court of the county  
| may designate an area other than an area at the county courthouse  
| where sales under this section will take place that is in a public  
| place within a reasonable proximity of the county courthouse as  
| determined by the commissioners court and in a location as  
| accessible to the public as the courthouse door.  The commissioners  
| court shall record that designation in the real property records of  
| the county.  A designation by a commissioners court under this  
| section is not a ground for challenging or invalidating any sale.  A  
| sale must be held at an area designated under this subsection if the  
| sale is held on or after the 90th day after the date the designation  
| is recorded.  
|  _(r-3)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (r), the sale of personal_  
| _property, including a manufactured home, may be conducted at the_  
| _same place as the sale of real property under Subsection (r) or at_  
| _the location of the personal property._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 33.56, Tax Code, as amended by this Act,  
| applies only to a petition to vacate a judgment for foreclosure of a  
| tax lien that is filed under that section on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. A petition to vacate a judgment for foreclosure of  
| a tax lien that is filed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the petition is filed, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

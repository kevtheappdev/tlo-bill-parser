| court, immediately after judgment is entered under Article 42.01,  
| shall determine if the defendant is indigent and, if so, whether the  
| defendant desires appointment of counsel for the purpose of a writ  
| of habeas corpus. If the defendant _has not elected to proceed pro_  
| _se, is not represented by retained counsel, and_ desires appointment  
| of counsel for the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus, the court

| represent the defendant as provided by Subsection (c).  
|  (c) At the earliest practical time, but in no event later  
| than 30 days, after the convicting court makes the findings  
| required under Subsections (a) and (b), the convicting court shall  
| appoint the office of capital and forensic writs _unless_ [ ~~or, if~~ ] the  
| office of capital and forensic writs does not accept or is  
| prohibited from accepting an appointment under Section 78.054,  
| Government Code, _or the convicting court determines good cause_  
| _exists for appointment of other counsel._ ___If the office of capital_  
| _and forensic writs is not appointed under this subsection, the_  
| _convicting court shall appoint_ other competent counsel under  
| Subsection _(d)_ [ ~~(f), unless the applicant elects to proceed pro se~~  
|  ~~or is represented by retained counsel~~ ].  
|  _(d)_ _____If the office of capital and forensic writs does not_  
| _accept or is prohibited from accepting an appointment under Section_  
| _78.054, Government Code, or the convicting court determines good_  
| _cause exists for appointment of other counsel, the convicting court_  
| _shall appoint counsel from a list of competent counsel maintained_  
| _by the presiding judges of the administrative judicial regions_  
| _under Section 78.056, Government Code._  
|  _(d-1)_ On appointing counsel under this section, the  
| convicting court shall immediately notify the court of criminal  
| appeals of the appointment, including in the notice a copy of the  
| judgment and the name, address, and telephone number of the  
| appointed counsel.  
|  (f) [ ~~If the office of capital and forensic writs does not~~  
|  ~~accept or is prohibited from accepting an appointment under Section~~

|  ~~Government Code.~~ ]  The convicting court shall reasonably compensate  
| as provided by Section 2A an attorney appointed under this section,  
| other than an attorney employed by the office of capital and  
| forensic writs, regardless of whether the attorney is appointed by  
| the convicting court or was appointed by the court of criminal  
| appeals under prior law.  An attorney appointed under this section  
| who is employed by the office of capital and forensic writs shall be  
| compensated in accordance with Subchapter B, Chapter 78, Government  
| Code.

| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (b-1) If the convicting court receives notice that the  
| requirements of Section 5(a) for consideration of a subsequent  
| application have been met and if the applicant has not elected to  
| proceed pro se and is not represented by retained counsel, the  
| convicting court shall appoint, in order of priority:  
|  (1) the attorney who represented the applicant in the  
| proceedings under Section 5, if the attorney seeks the appointment  
| _and is otherwise competent for that purpose_ ;  
|  (2) the office of capital and forensic writs, if the  
| office represented the applicant in the proceedings under Section 5  
| or otherwise accepts the appointment _in accordance with Chapter 78,_  
| _Government Code_ ; or  
|  (3) counsel from a list of competent counsel  
| maintained by the presiding judges of the administrative judicial  
| regions under Section 78.056, Government Code, if _counsel is not_  
| _appointed under Subdivision (1) or (2) or if the convicting court_  
| _determines good cause exists for appointment of counsel other than_  
| _counsel described by those subdivisions_ [ ~~the office of capital and~~  
|  ~~forensic writs:~~

| _tax and adopted under Section 328.003 must specify the tax rate._  
|  _(b)_ _____A qualifying local government that imposes the_

| _order annually increase or reduce the rate of the tax in increments_

| _not impair any outstanding debt or other obligation payable from_  
| _the tax._  
|  _(c)_ _____A qualifying local government that imposes the_  
| _supplemental sales and use tax may by adoption of an ordinance or_  
| _order abolish the tax if there is no outstanding debt secured by the_

| _to the comptroller the copy of the ordinance or order adopting,_  
| _increasing, reducing, or abolishing the tax, as applicable._  
|  _Sec._ ___328.006._ _____EFFECT ON COMBINED LOCAL TAX RATE. The rate_

| _supplemental sales and use tax is for the use and benefit of the_

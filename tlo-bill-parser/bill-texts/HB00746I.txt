|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the establishment by certain counties and hospital  
| districts of disease control pilot programs to reduce the risk of  
| certain infectious and communicable diseases; authorizing fees.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The legislature finds that because drug abuse  
| has been a tragedy for many Texas families, it is imperative for  
| individuals addicted to drugs to receive education about and  
| treatment for addiction. Cooperation with community-based and  
| faith-based organizations creates a network of support for Texas  
| families and the opportunity to intervene in drug addiction.  
| Members of community-based and faith-based organizations have a  
| strong desire to compassionately work to preserve lives and offer  
| help to those stricken with disease and drug addiction.  
|  Allowing for the operation of disease control pilot programs  
| will reduce the transmission of bloodborne diseases, including  
| HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, and provide clients with  
| referrals to appropriate health and social services. A pilot  
| program created under this Act may provide necessary access to  
| primary health care, ensure safe and sterile disposal of used  
| syringes and needles, and protect the public health. In addition,  
| pilot program goals may include reduced rates of intravenous drug  
| use and a reduced number of injuries to innocent victims, first  
| responders, and law enforcement caused by needle sticks from  
| improperly disposed needles. Additionally, it is the intent of the  
| legislature for the pilot program to increase access to drug  
| treatment centers, increase the likelihood of successful  
| treatments for addiction, and protect the public health and safety.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 531.0972, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 531.0972. PILOT PROGRAM TO PREVENT [ ~~THE~~ ] SPREAD OF

| _81, Health and Safety Code,_ [ ~~funded by the county~~ ] to prevent the  
| spread of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other infectious and  
| communicable diseases.  The program may include a disease control  
| program that provides for the anonymous exchange of used hypodermic  
| needles and syringes.

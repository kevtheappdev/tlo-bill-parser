|  AN ACT  
| relating to the state salary for retired judges.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:

| legislation increasing the state salary of district or appellate  
| judges or justices or authorizes a state salary increase for  
| district or appellate judges or justices in the General  
| Appropriations Act, on the effective date of the salary increase,

| annuities of persons who retired before the effective date of the  
|  
| salary increase under Sections 839.102 or 839.103, Government Code,

| elected or appointed.  On the effective date of a state salary  
| increase described by this Act, the retirement system shall also

|  _Sec. 208.0001. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Aquifer storage and recovery project" means a_  
| _project involving the injection of water into a geologic formation_  
| _for the purpose of subsequent recovery and beneficial use._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Commission" means the Texas Commission on_  
| _Environmental Quality._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Produced water" means water produced in oil or_

| _the amount and under the conditions and limitations provided by_  
| _this chapter if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the producer provides to a project operator_  
| _produced water that has a total dissolved solids concentration of_  
| _more than 90,000 milligrams per liter; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the project operator treats the water for_  
| _injection into an aquifer for storage and recovery and shall not_

| _produced water described by Subsection (a) provided to a project_  
| _operator during the reporting period that is subsequently treated_

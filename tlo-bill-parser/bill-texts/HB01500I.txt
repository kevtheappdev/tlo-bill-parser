|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to prohibiting abortions after detection of an unborn  
| child's heartbeat and to requirements for performing or inducing an  
| abortion; authorizing an administrative penalty; creating a  
| criminal offense.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. This Act shall be known as the Texas Heartbeat  
| Bill.  
|  SECTION 2. Chapter 171, Health and Safety Code, is amended  
| by adding Subchapter H to read as follows:  
| _SUBCHAPTER H. DETECTION OF FETAL HEARTBEAT_  
|  _Sec. 171.201. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Fetal heartbeat" means cardiac activity or the_  
| _steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart_  
| _within the gestational sac._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Gestational age" means the amount of time that_  
| _has elapsed from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Gestational sac" means the structure comprising_  
| _the extraembryonic membranes that envelop the unborn child and that_  
| _is typically visible by ultrasound after the fourth week of_  
| _pregnancy._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Physician" means an individual licensed to_  
| _practice medicine in this state, including a medical doctor and a_  
| _doctor of osteopathic medicine._  
|  _(5)_ _____"Pregnancy" means the human female reproductive_  
| _condition that:_  
|  _(A) begins with fertilization;_  
|  _(B)_ _____occurs when the woman is carrying the_  
| _developing human offspring; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____is calculated from the first day of the_ __  
| _woman's last menstrual period._  
|  _(6)_ _____"Standard medical practice" means the degree of_  
| _skill, care, and diligence that a physician of the same medical_  
| _specialty would employ in similar circumstances._  
|  _(7)_ _____"Unborn child" means an offspring of human beings_  
| _from fertilization until birth._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.202._ _____LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds,_  
| _according to contemporary medical research, that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____as many as 30 percent of natural pregnancies end in_  
| _spontaneous miscarriage;_  
|  _(2)_ _____less than five percent of all natural pregnancies_  
| _end in spontaneous miscarriage after detection of fetal cardiac_  
| _activity;_  
|  _(3)_ _____over 90 percent of in vitro pregnancies survive_  
| _the first trimester if cardiac activity is detected in the_  
| _gestational sac;_  
|  _(4)_ _____nearly 90 percent of in vitro pregnancies do not_  
| _survive the first trimester where cardiac activity is not detected_  
| _in the gestational sac;_  
|  _(5)_ _____fetal heartbeat, therefore, has become a key_  
| _medical predictor that an unborn child will reach live birth;_  
|  _(6)_ _____cardiac activity begins at a biologically_  
| _identifiable moment in time, normally when the fetal heart is_  
| _formed in the gestational sac;_  
|  _(7)_ _____Texas has legitimate interests from the outset of_  
| _a woman's pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the_  
| _life of an unborn child who may be born; and_  
|  _(8)_ _____to make an informed choice about whether to_  
| _continue her pregnancy, the pregnant woman has a legitimate_  
| _interest in knowing the likelihood of the unborn child surviving to_  
| _full-term birth based on the presence of cardiac activity._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.203._ _____DETERMINATION OF PRESENCE OF FETAL HEARTBEAT_  
| _REQUIRED; RECORD. (a) Except as provided by Section 171.205, a_

| _with this section, whether the woman's unborn child has a_  
| _detectable fetal heartbeat._  
|  _(b)_ _____In making a determination under Subsection (a), the_  
| _physician must use a test that is:_  
|  _(1)_ _____consistent with the physician's good faith_  
| _understanding of standard medical practice;_  
|  _(2)_ _____consistent with rules adopted under this_  
| _subchapter; and_

| _pregnancy._  
|  _(c)_ _____A physician making a determination under Subsection (a)_  
| _shall record in the pregnant woman's medical record the estimated_

| _the test._  
|  _(d)_ _____The executive commissioner may adopt rules specifying_  
| _the appropriate tests to be used in determining the presence of a_  
| _fetal heartbeat based on standard medical practice._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.204._ _____ABORTION OF UNBORN CHILD WITH DETECTABLE_  
| _FETAL HEARTBEAT PROHIBITED. (a) Except as provided by Section_  
| _171.205, a physician may not intentionally perform or induce an_  
| _abortion on a pregnant woman with the specific intent of causing or_  
| _abetting the termination of the life of the woman's unborn child if_  
| _the physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child under_  
| _Section 171.203 or failed to perform a test to detect a fetal_  
| _heartbeat._  
|  _(b)_ _____A physician does not violate this section if the_  
| _physician performed a test for a fetal heartbeat under Section_  
| _171.203 and did not detect a fetal heartbeat._

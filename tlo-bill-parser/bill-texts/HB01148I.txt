| _of that year_ [ ~~five percent~~ ] instead of the rate provided by Section  
| 33.01.  Interest and penalties that accrued or that were incurred or

| deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 181st day after  
| the date the deferral or abatement period expires.  A plea of  
| limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against  
| the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as  
| provided by this section.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 33.065(g), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (g) A tax lien remains on the property and interest  
| continues to accrue during the period collection of delinquent  
| taxes is deferred or abated under this section. The annual interest  
| rate _in effect for each calendar year or portion of a calendar year_  
| during the deferral or abatement period is _the five-year Constant_  
| _Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve Board as of_  
| _January 1 of that year_ [ ~~eight percent~~ ] instead of the rate provided  
| by Section 33.01. Interest and penalties that accrued or that were  
| incurred or imposed under Section 33.01 or 33.07 before the date the  
| individual files the deferral affidavit under Subsection (c) or the  
| date the judgment abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are  
| preserved. A penalty is not incurred on the delinquent taxes for  
| which collection is deferred or abated during a deferral or

| be imposed and collected only if the delinquent taxes for which  
| collection is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the  
| 91st day after the date the deferral or abatement period expires. A  
| plea of limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply  
| against the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of  
| collection as provided by this section.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 33.06(d) and 33.065(g), Tax Code, as

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to calculation of daily production for purposes of the oil  
| and gas production tax credits for low-producing wells and leases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 201.059(a)(3), Tax Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (3) "Qualifying low-producing well" means a gas well  
| whose production during a three-month period is no more than 90 mcf  
| per day, excluding gas flared pursuant to the rules of the  
| commission.  For purposes of qualifying a gas well, production per  
| well per day is determined by computing the average daily  
| production from the well using the _greater of the monthly_  
| _production from the well as reported in the_ monthly well production  
| _reports_ [ ~~report~~ ] made to the commission _and the monthly production_  
| _from the well as reported in the producer's reports made to the_  
| _comptroller under Section 201.203, including any amendments to_  
| _those reports_.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 202.058(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) For purposes of qualifying a lease, production per well  
| per day is determined by computing the average daily per well  
| production from the lease using the _greater of the monthly_  
| _production from the well as reported in the_ monthly lease  
| production _reports_ [ ~~report~~ ] made to the commission _and the monthly_  
| _production from the well as reported in the producer's reports made_  
| _to the comptroller under Section 202.201, including any amendments_  
| _to those reports_.  For purposes of qualifying a lease, production  
| per well per day is measured by dividing the sum of lease production  
| during the three-month period by the sum of the number of well-days,  
| where a well-day is one well producing for one day. The operator of  
| a lease that is eligible for a credit under this section only on the  
| basis of Subsection (a)(2)(B) must pay to the comptroller a filing  
| fee of $100 before the comptroller may authorize the credit.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act does not  
| affect tax liability accruing before the effective date of this  
| Act. That liability continues in effect as if this Act had not been  
| enacted, and the former law is continued in effect for the  
| collection of taxes due and for civil and criminal enforcement of  
| the liability for those taxes.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

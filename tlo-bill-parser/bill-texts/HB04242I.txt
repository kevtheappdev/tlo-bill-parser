|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the administration of state assessments.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 39.023, Education Code, is amended by a  
| adding Subsection (a-14) and (q) and amending (a-11) and (e) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a-11) Before an assessment instrument adopted or developed  
| under Subsection (a) may be administered under that subsection, the  
| assessment instrument must, on the basis of empirical evidence, be  
| determined to be valid and reliable by an entity that is independent  
| of the agency and of any other entity that developed the assessment  
| instrument. _To the extent practicable, each assessment must also_  
| _be evaluated by an independent group of qualified educators with_  
| _Texas teaching experience for readability within the grade level_  
| _assessed, and each assessment item of sufficient length must be_  
| _separately evaluated for readability within the grade level_  
| _assessed before being field-tested under subsection (d). A_  
| _determination of readability must consider available correlations_  
| _with other assessments commonly used by Texas school districts, and_  
| _shall be verified by an independent group of qualified educators_  
| _with Texas teaching experience. The commissioner shall hold a_  
| _public hearing before making a determination as to readability of_  
| _assessments and before any decision under this section._  
|  _(a-14)_ _____Each reading assessment instrument adopted or_  
| _developed under Subsection (a) shall be comprised of assessment_  
| _passages, items, or questions that are aligned with the essential_  
| _skills and knowledge established by the State Board of Education_  
| _under Section 39.021 for a course, subject, and grade level, and_  
| _that have been determined to be written at the independent reading_  
| _level based on multiple generally accepted reliable measures of_  
| _readability and as verified by an independent group of qualified_  
| _educators with Texas teaching experience._  
|  (e) Under rules adopted by the State Board of Education,  
| every third year, the agency shall release the questions and answer  
| keys to each assessment instrument administered under Subsection  
| (a), (b), (c), (d), or (l), excluding any assessment instrument  
| administered to a student for the purpose of retaking the  
| assessment instrument, after the last time the instrument is  
| administered for that school year. To ensure a valid bank of  
| questions for use each year, the agency is not required to release a  
| question that is being field-tested and was not used to compute the  
| student's score on the instrument. The agency shall also release,  
| under board rule, each question that is no longer being  
| field-tested and that was not used to compute a student's score.  
| During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, the agency shall  
| release the questions and answer keys to assessment instruments as  
| described by this subsection each year. _At the time that the agency_  
| _releases the questions and answer keys for an assessment_  
| _instrument, the agency also shall release the measures of_  
| _readability for each question and reading passage as determined_  
| _under Subsection (a-14)._  
|  _(q)_ _____The State Board of Education shall periodically review,_  
| _at least once each year, the assessment instruments adopted or_  
| _developed under Subsection (a) and the measures of readability_  
| _determined under Subsection (a-14). Any review of assessment_  
| _instruments and measures of readability that have not been released_  
| _under Subsection (e) may be conducted in closed session._  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter B, Chapter 39, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 39.02302 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___39.02302._ _____TRANSITION FOR READABILITY MEASURES. (a)_  
| _No later than November 1, 2019, the commissioner shall complete an_  
| _evaluation of readability within grade level for each assessment_  
| _required under Section 39.023(a) and administered during or_  
| _following the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years and provide the_  
| _results of the evaluation to each legislative oversight committee_  
| _and the governor._  
|  _(b)_ _____State assessment performance labels and numeric values,_  
| _(including, but not limited to the following: approaches, meets,_  
| _and masters grade level), sanctions, interventions and SSI_  
| _promotion requirements shall not be applied to students, campuses_  
| _or districts based on the results of the 2018-2019 state_  
| _assessments unless:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a district or campus moves from an unacceptable to_  
| _an acceptable rating; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____allows a student to comply with a high school_  
| _graduation requirement based on successful performance on an_  
| _assessment._  
|  _(c)_ _____State assessment instruments shall not be administered_  
| _during the 2019-2020 or any later school year unless they meet the_  
| _readability standards in section 39.023(a-11) and (a-14). If an_  
| _assessment instrument does not meet the readability standards in_  
| _section 39.023 (a-11) and (a-14), the Commissioner shall request a_  
| _federal waiver, if needed, from the requirements of the Every_  
| _Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)(20 U.S.C. Section 6301 et seq.) to_  
| _comply with this section._  
|  _(d)_ _____To the extent a state assessment is not available that_  
| _meets the requirements of section 39.023(a-11) and (a-14) for the_  
| _2019-2020 school year, the commissioner shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____request a waiver as necessary to comply with this_  
| _section;_  
|  _(2)_ _____except as provided by subsection (3), not assign a_  
| _state district or campus rating, impose any district or campus_  
| _sanction, or require any student promotion condition that is based_  
| _in whole or in part on an assessment not meeting the requirements of_  
| _section 39.023(a-11) and (a-14) unless expressly required by_  
| _federal law and is not waived; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____assign a district or campus rating based in whole_  
| _or in part on an assessment not meeting the requirements of section_  
| _39.023(a-11) and (a-14) only to the extent a district or campus_  
| _moves from an unacceptable to an acceptable rating._  
|  _(e)_ _____Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the_  
| _ability of a student to comply with a high school graduation_  
| _requirement based on successful performance on an assessment._  
|  _(f) This section expires September 1, 2021._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 39.0241(a), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commissioner shall determine the level of  
| performance considered to be satisfactory on the assessment  
| instruments ~~.~~ _, provided that satisfactory performance shall be_  
| _based on grade level expectations for a course or subject and shall_  
| _be consistent with other indicators of grade level performance,_  
| _including the measures of readability determined under Subsection_  
| _39.023(a-14)._  
|  SECTION 4. This Act applies beginning with the 2019-2020  
| school year.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to awarding certain medals for military service performed  
| individually or as part of a crew.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 437.352, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 437.352. LONE STAR MEDAL OF VALOR. The Lone Star Medal  
| of Valor shall be awarded to a member of the military forces of this  
| state, another state, or the United States who performs _, either_  
| _individually or as a member of a crew,_ specific acts of bravery or  
| outstanding courage, or who performs within an exceptionally short  
| period _, either individually or as a member of a crew,_ a closely  
| related series of heroic acts, if the acts involve personal hazard  
| or danger and the voluntary risk of life and result in an  
| accomplishment so exceptional and outstanding as to clearly set the  
| person _or crew_ apart from the person's _or crew's_ comrades or from  
| other persons in similar circumstances.  Awarding of the medal  
| requires a lesser degree of gallantry than awarding of the Texas  
| Legislative Medal of Honor, but requires that the acts be performed  
| with marked distinction.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 437.355(a), Government Code, is amended

|  AN ACT  
| relating to the automatic enrollment of certain women in the  
| Healthy Texas Women program.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 531, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 531.0997 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___531.0997._ _____AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT OF CERTAIN WOMEN IN_  
| _HEALTHY TEXAS WOMEN PROGRAM. (a)_ ___In this section, "Healthy Texas_  
| _Women program" means a program operated by the commission that is_  
| _substantially similar to the demonstration project operated under_  
| _former Section 32.0248, Human Resources Code, and that is intended_  
| _to expand access to preventive health and family planning services_  
| _for women in this state._  
|  _(b)_ _____Subject to the eligibility requirements of the Healthy_  
| _Texas Women program, the commission shall identify and_  
| _automatically enroll in the program a woman who is a Medicaid_  
| _recipient or enrollee in the child health plan program but who will_  
| _lose eligibility for benefits under the applicable program because_  
| _of the woman's age. The commission shall implement the automatic_  
| _enrollment in a manner that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____ensures a seamless transition in the provision of_  
| _services between Medicaid or the child health plan program, as_  
| _applicable, and the Healthy Texas Women program; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____allows a woman to begin receiving services through_  
| _the Healthy Texas Women program on the first day the woman is no_  
| _longer eligible for Medicaid or the child health plan program, as_  
| _applicable._  
|  _(c)_ _____The executive commissioner shall adopt rules necessary_  
| _to implement this section._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2020.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to public access to juvenile court proceedings.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 54.08, Family Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 54.08. PUBLIC ACCESS TO COURT _PROCEEDINGS_ [ ~~HEARINGS~~ ].  
| (a)  Except as provided by this section, the court shall open  
| _proceedings_ [ ~~hearings~~ ] under this title to the public unless the  
| court, _on the motion of any party to a proceeding and based on the_  
| _evidence presented_ [ ~~for good cause shown~~ ], determines that _:_  
|  _(1)_ _____there exists a reasonable and substantial basis_  
| _for believing that public access to the proceeding could harm the_  
| _child, endanger the child's right to a fair trial, or endanger a_  
| _victim of the conduct of the child;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the potential for harm to the child or a victim_  
| _outweighs the benefits of public access to the proceeding; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the harm can be remedied only by excluding the_  
| _public from the proceeding_ [ ~~the public should be excluded~~ ].  
|  (b) _A motion by a party to exclude the public from a_  
| _proceeding must be made in writing and served on all parties not_  
| _later than the third day before the date the proceeding is scheduled_  
| _to occur._  
|  _(c)_ _____On receipt of a motion to exclude the public from a_  
| _proceeding, the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing in open_  
| _court on the motion to determine whether exclusion of the public_  
| _from the proceeding is warranted under Subsection (a)._ ___General_  
| _considerations, including concern for rehabilitation of the child,_  
| _are insufficient to warrant exclusion of the public from a_  
| _proceeding._  
|  _(d)_ _____On conclusion of the evidentiary hearing under_  
| _Subsection (c), the court shall order the proceeding to be open to_  
| _the public unless the court issues written findings of fact and_  
| _conclusions of law stating that the evidence of potential harm to_  
| _the child or to a victim presented under Subsection (a) clearly_  
| _outweighs the public interest in a proceeding that is open to the_  
| _public._  
|  _(e)_ _____Any party to a proceeding has standing to appeal an_  
| _order of the court excluding the public from the proceeding._  
|  _(f)_ _____Any party to a proceeding objecting to an order_  
| _excluding the public from the proceeding is entitled to an_  
| _immediate appeal of that order._ ___The notice of appeal must be filed_  
| _not later than the seventh day after the date the order is entered_  
| _or the date the public is excluded from the proceeding._ ___The filing_  
| _of a notice of appeal shall stay further proceedings pending the_  
| _disposition of the interlocutory appeal._  
|  _(g)_ _____The court of appeals shall expeditiously review an_  
| _appeal under this section._  
|  _(h)_ The court may not prohibit a person who is a victim of  
| the conduct of a child, or the person's family, from personally  
| attending a _proceeding_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] under this title relating to the  
| conduct by the child unless the victim or member of the victim's  
| family is to testify in the _proceeding_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] or any subsequent  
| _proceeding_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] relating to the conduct and the court  
| determines that the victim's or family member's testimony would be  
| materially affected if the victim or member of the victim's family  
| hears other testimony at trial.  
|  _(i)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] If a child is under the age of 14 at the time of  
| the _proceeding:_ [ ~~hearing,~~ ]  
|  _(1)_ _____Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g)_  
| _do not apply to a proceeding involving the child; and_  
|  _(2)_ the court shall close the _proceeding_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] to  
| the public unless the court finds that the interests of the child or  
| the interests of the public would be better served by opening the  
| _proceeding_ [ ~~hearing~~ ] to the public.  
|  _(j)_ [ ~~(d)~~ ] In this section, "family" has the meaning  
| assigned by Section 71.003.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

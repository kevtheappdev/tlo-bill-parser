|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the protection of parental rights.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 153.002, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 153.002. _THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF PARENTS AND THE_ BEST  
| INTEREST OF CHILD _REN_. _(a)_ ___It is the public policy of this state, in_  
| _a suit between a parent and a non-parent, to recognize that in order_  
| _to preserve the best interests of Texas children and families the_  
| _state may not inject itself into the private realm of the family to_  
| _interfere with the right and the high duty of parents to raise their_  
| _children without first overcoming the presumption that a parent is_  
| _fit and that a fit parent acts in the best interests of their child;_  
|  _(b)_ The best interest of the child shall always be the  
| primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of  
| conservatorship and possession of and access to the child _;_  
|  _(c)_ _____The fundamental right of parents to raise their children_  
| _includes but is not limited to the right to direct the care,_  
| _custody, control, education, upbringing, moral and religious_  
| _training, and health care of their child;_  
|  _(d)_ _____A fit parent is one who adequately cares for his or her_  
| _children;_  
|  _(e) In a suit between a parent and a non-parent:_  
|  _(1)_ _____Neither the State of Texas nor any political_  
| _subdivision of this state may restrict or interfere with a parent's_  
| _fundamental right to raise their children unless it is demonstrated_  
| _that the restriction or interference is both:_  
|  _(A)_ _____essential to further a compelling_  
| _governmental interest; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____narrowly tailored to accomplish the_  
| _compelling governmental interest;_  
|  _(2)_ _____A court in this state may not interfere with the_  
| _fundamental right of parents to raise their children simply because_  
| _the court believes a better decision could be made._ ___Before a court_  
| _may interfere with the fundamental right of parents to raise their_  
| _children, the court must first overcome the presumption that the_  
| _parent is fit and that a fit parent acts in the best interests of_  
| _their child._ ___Any restriction on or interference by a court with a_  
| _parent's fundamental right must be supported by a finding that:_  
|  _(A) the parent is unfit; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____the interference is necessary to prevent a_  
| _significant impairment of the child's physical health or emotional_  
| _well being;_  
|  _(f)_ _____Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit_  
| _the_  
| _right of the state to investigate or act upon a report of child_  
| _abuse or neglect allegedly committed by a person responsible for a_  
| _child's care, custody, or welfare beyond the limitations already_  
| _required by the United States Constitution._

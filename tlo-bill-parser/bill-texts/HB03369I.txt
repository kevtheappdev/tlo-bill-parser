| decision.  
|  (d) A physician, health professional acting under the  
| direction of a physician, or health care facility is not civilly or  
| criminally liable or subject to review or disciplinary action by  
| the person's appropriate licensing board if the person has complied  
| with the procedures _and limitations_ outlined in _Sections 166.0455_

| _decision made by or on behalf of a patient that directs the_  
| _provision of life-sustaining treatment and shall not consider_  
| _life-sustaining treatment to be inappropriate treatment under_

|  _(1)_ _____the lesser value the physician or professional,_  
| _facility, or committee places on sustaining the life of an elderly,_  
| _disabled, or terminally ill patient compared to the value of_  
| _sustaining the life of a patient who is younger, not disabled, or_

| _professional, facility, or committee and the patient, or the person_

| _Section 166.039, over the greater weight the patient or person_  
| _places on sustaining the patient's life than the risk of_  
| _disability; or_  
|  _(3) the financial condition of the patient._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 166.046, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) and  
| adding Subsections (a-1), (a-2), and (c-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) If an attending physician refuses to honor _or comply_  
| _with_ a patient's advance directive or a health care or treatment  
| decision made by or on behalf of a patient _for a reason permitted by_  
| _Subsection (a-1) and not prohibited by Section 166.0455_ , the  
| physician's refusal shall be reviewed by an ethics or medical  
| committee. The attending physician may not be a member of that

| during the review. _A person may not coerce or attempt to coerce a_  
| _physician not to comply with a patient's advance directive or a_  
| _health care or treatment decision made by or on behalf of a patient_  
| _by threatening or implementing adverse employment decisions or_  
| _professional discipline._  
|  _(a-1)_ _____The ethics or medical committee reviewing the_  
| _physician's refusal under Subsection (a) shall not consider_  
| _life-sustaining treatment inappropriate unless, based on_  
| _reasonable medical judgment, the life-sustaining treatment_  
| _requested by or on behalf of the patient is:_  
|  _(1)_ _____futile because the treatment is physiologically_  
| _ineffective in achieving the specific intended benefit to the_  
| _patient as intended by or on behalf of the patient; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____medically inappropriate because providing the_  
| _treatment to the patient would clearly create a substantially_  
| _greater risk of causing or hastening the death of the patient than_  
| _would withholding or withdrawing the treatment._  
|  _(a-2)_ _____An ethics or medical committee shall record a meeting_  
| _held under this section._

| medical committee review process and any other policies and  
| procedures related to this section adopted by the health care

| provided:  
|  (A) a copy of the appropriate statement set forth  
| in Section 166.052; and  
|  (B) a copy of the registry list of health care  
| providers and referral groups that have volunteered their readiness

| patient's medical record related to the treatment received by the  
| patient in the facility for the lesser of:

| _or ethics or medical committee's statements; and_  
|  _(F)_ _____after the ethics or medical committee has_  
| _rendered a decision:_  
|  _(i)_ _____receive a written explanation of the_

| _166.0455._  
|  (d) If the attending physician, the patient, or the person  
| responsible for the health care decisions of the individual does  
| not agree with the decision reached during the review process under  
| Subsection (b), the physician shall make a reasonable effort _, in_  
| _accordance with rules adopted by the executive commissioner,_ to  
| transfer the patient to a physician who is willing to comply with  
| the directive. If the patient is a patient in a health care  
| facility, the facility's personnel shall assist the physician in  
| arranging the patient's transfer to:  
|  (1) another physician;  
|  (2) an alternative care setting within that facility;  
| or  
|  (3) another facility.  
|  (e) If the patient or the person responsible for the health  
| care decisions of the patient is requesting life-sustaining  
| treatment that the attending physician has decided and the ethics  
| or medical committee has affirmed is medically inappropriate  
| treatment, the patient shall be given available life-sustaining  
| treatment pending transfer under Subsection (d). This subsection  
| does not authorize withholding or withdrawing pain management  
| medication, medical procedures necessary to provide comfort, or any  
| other health care provided to alleviate a patient's pain. The  
| patient is responsible for any costs incurred in transferring the  
| patient to another facility. The attending physician, any other  
| physician responsible for the care of the patient, and the health  
| care facility are not obligated to provide life-sustaining  
| treatment after the _45th_ [ ~~10th~~ ] day after both the written decision  
| and the patient's medical record required under Subsection (b) are  
| provided to the patient or the person responsible for the health  
| care decisions of the patient unless ordered to do so under  
| Subsection (g), except that artificially administered nutrition  
| and hydration must be provided unless, based on reasonable medical  
| judgment, providing artificially administered nutrition and  
| hydration would:  
|  (1) hasten the patient's death;  
|  (2) be medically contraindicated such that the  
| provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening  
| medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of  
| the treatment;  
|  (3) result in substantial irremediable physical pain  
| not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of the treatment;  
|  (4) be medically ineffective in prolonging life; or  
|  (5) be contrary to the patient's or surrogate's  
| clearly documented desire not to receive artificially administered  
| nutrition or hydration.  
|  (g) At the request of the patient or the person responsible  
| for the health care decisions of the patient, the appropriate  
| [ ~~district or county~~ ] court shall extend the time period provided  
| under Subsection (e) [ ~~only~~ ] if the court finds, by a preponderance  
| of the evidence, that there is a reasonable expectation that a  
| physician or health care facility that will honor the patient's  
| directive will be found if the time extension is granted.

|  SECTION 7. Sections 166.052(a) and (b), Health and Safety  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In cases in which the attending physician refuses to  
| honor an advance directive or health care or treatment decision  
| requesting the provision of life-sustaining treatment, the  
| statement required by Section 166.046(b)(3)(A) shall be in  
| substantially the following form:  
| When There Is A Disagreement About Medical Treatment:  The  
| Physician Recommends Against Certain Life-Sustaining Treatment  
| That You Wish To Continue  
|  You have been given this information because you have  
| requested life-sustaining treatment* for yourself as the patient or  
| on behalf of the patient, as applicable, which the attending  
| physician believes is not medically appropriate.  This information  
| is being provided to help you understand state law, your rights, and  
| the resources available to you in such circumstances.  It outlines  
| the process for resolving disagreements about treatment among  
| patients, families, and physicians.  It is based upon Section  
| 166.046 of the Texas Advance Directives Act, codified in Chapter  
| 166, Texas Health and Safety Code.  
|  When an attending physician refuses to comply with an advance  
| directive or other request for life-sustaining treatment because of  
| the physician's judgment that the treatment would be medically  
| inappropriate, the case will be reviewed by an ethics or medical  
| committee.  Life-sustaining treatment will be provided through the  
| review.  
|  You will receive notification of this review at least _seven_  
| _days_ [ ~~48 hours~~ ] before a meeting of the committee related to your  
| case.  You are entitled to attend _and participate in_ the _entire_  
| meeting _with an attorney and patient advocate_.  With your  
| agreement, the meeting may be held sooner than 48 hours, if  
| possible.  
|  _A physician or other health care professional, a health care_  
| _facility, or an ethics or medical committee may not deny a patient_  
| _life-sustaining treatment based on:_  
|  _1._ _____the lesser value the physician or professional,_  
| _facility, or committee places on sustaining the life of an elderly,_  
| _disabled, or terminally ill patient compared to the value of_  
| _sustaining the life of a patient who is younger, not disabled, or_  
| _not terminally ill;_  
|  _2._ _____a disagreement between the physician or professional,_  
| _facility, or committee and the patient, or the person authorized to_  
| _make a treatment decision for the patient under Section 166.039,_  
| _over the greater weight the patient or person places on sustaining_  
| _the patient's life than the risk of disability; or_  
|  _3. the patient's financial condition._  
|  _Life-sustaining treatment may be denied if the treatment is:_  
|  _1._ _____futile because the treatment is physiologically_  
| _ineffective in achieving the specific intended benefit to the_  
| _patient as intended by or on behalf of the patient; or_  
|  _2._ _____medically inappropriate because providing the treatment_  
| _to the patient would clearly create a substantially greater risk of_  
| _causing or hastening the death of the patient than would_  
| _withholding or withdrawing it._  
|  You are entitled to receive a written explanation of the  
| decision reached during the review process _and the medical judgment_  
| _and reason leading to the decision_.  
|  If after this review process both the attending physician and  
| the ethics or medical committee conclude that life-sustaining  
| treatment is medically inappropriate and yet you continue to  
| request such treatment, then the following procedure will occur:  
|  1. The physician, with the help of the health care facility,  
| will assist you in trying to find a physician and facility willing  
| to provide the requested treatment.  
|  2. You are being given a list of health care providers,  
| licensed physicians, health care facilities, and referral groups  
| that have volunteered their readiness to consider accepting  
| transfer, or to assist in locating a provider willing to accept  
| transfer, maintained by the Department of State Health Services.  
| You may wish to contact providers, facilities, or referral groups  
| on the list or others of your choice to get help in arranging a  
| transfer.  
|  3. The patient will continue to be given life-sustaining  
| treatment until the patient can be transferred to a willing  
| provider for up to _45_ [ ~~10~~ ] days from the time you were given both
the  
| committee's written decision _and explanation_ that life-sustaining  
| treatment is not appropriate and the patient's medical record.  The  
| patient will continue to be given after the _45-day_ [ ~~10-day~~ ] period  
| treatment to enhance pain management and reduce suffering,  
| including artificially administered nutrition and hydration,  
| unless, based on reasonable medical judgment, providing  
| artificially administered nutrition and hydration would hasten the  
| patient's death, be medically contraindicated such that the  
| provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening  
| medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of  
| the treatment, result in substantial irremediable physical pain not  
| outweighed by the benefit of the provision of the treatment, be  
| medically ineffective in prolonging life, or be contrary to the  
| patient's or surrogate's clearly documented desires.  
|  4. If a transfer can be arranged, the patient will be  
| responsible for the costs of the transfer.  
|  5. If a provider cannot be found willing to give the  
| requested treatment within _45_ [ ~~10~~ ] days, life-sustaining treatment  
| may be withdrawn unless a court of law has _ruled otherwise_ [ ~~granted~~  
|  ~~an extension~~ ].  
|  6. You may ask the [ ~~appropriate district or county~~ ] court to  
| extend the _45-day_ [ ~~10-day~~ ] period if the court finds that there is a  
| reasonable expectation that you may find a physician or health care  
| facility willing to provide life-sustaining treatment if the  
| extension is granted.  Patient medical records will be provided to  
| the patient or surrogate in accordance with Section 241.154, Texas  
| Health and Safety Code.  
|  _7._ _____The law gives you the right to seek a court order to_  
| _require a physician or other health care professional, health care_  
| _facility, or ethics or medical committee to comply with your rights_  
| _under the Texas Advance Directives Act if the physician or_  
| _professional, facility, or committee is violating or threatening to_  
| _violate a provision of that Act. You may wish to talk to legal_  
| _counsel for further information about your right to seek a court_  
| _order._  
|  *"Life-sustaining treatment" means treatment that, based on  
| reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and  
| without which the patient will die. The term includes both  
| life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as  
| mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and  
| artificially administered nutrition and hydration. The term does  
| not include the administration of pain management medication or the  
| performance of a medical procedure considered to be necessary to  
| provide comfort care, or any other medical care provided to  
| alleviate a patient's pain.  
|  (b) In cases in which the attending physician refuses to  
| comply with an advance directive or treatment decision requesting  
| the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, the  
| statement required by Section 166.046(b)(3)(A) shall be in  
| substantially the following form:  
| When There Is A Disagreement About Medical Treatment: The  
| Physician Recommends Life-Sustaining Treatment That You Wish To  
| Stop  
|  You have been given this information because you have  
| requested the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining  
| treatment* for yourself as the patient or on behalf of the patient,  
| as applicable, and the attending physician disagrees with and  
| refuses to comply with that request. The information is being  
| provided to help you understand state law, your rights, and the  
| resources available to you in such circumstances. It outlines the  
| process for resolving disagreements about treatment among  
| patients, families, and physicians. It is based upon Section  
| 166.046 of the Texas Advance Directives Act, codified in Chapter  
| 166, Texas Health and Safety Code.  
|  When an attending physician refuses to comply with an advance  
| directive or other request for withdrawal or withholding of  
| life-sustaining treatment for any reason, the case will be reviewed  
| by an ethics or medical committee. Life-sustaining treatment will  
| be provided through the review.  
|  You will receive notification of this review at least _seven_  
| _days_ [ ~~48 hours~~ ] before a meeting of the committee related to your  
| case. You are entitled to attend _and participate in_ the _entire_  
| meeting _with an attorney and patient advocate_. With your  
| agreement, the meeting may be held sooner than 48 hours, if  
| possible.  
|  You are entitled to receive a written explanation of the  
| decision reached during the review process _and the medical judgment_  
| _and reason leading to the decision_.  
|  If you or the attending physician do not agree with the  
| decision reached during the review process, and the attending  
| physician still refuses to comply with your request to withhold or  
| withdraw life-sustaining treatment, then the following procedure  
| will occur:  
|  1. The physician, with the help of the health care facility,  
| will assist you in trying to find a physician and facility willing  
| to withdraw or withhold the life-sustaining treatment.  
|  2. You are being given a list of health care providers,  
| licensed physicians, health care facilities, and referral groups  
| that have volunteered their readiness to consider accepting  
| transfer, or to assist in locating a provider willing to accept  
| transfer, maintained by the Department of State Health  
| Services. You may wish to contact providers, facilities, or  
| referral groups on the list or others of your choice to get help in  
| arranging a transfer.  
|  _3._ _____The law gives you a right to seek a court order to require_  
| _a physician or other health care professional, health care_  
| _facility, or ethics or medical committee to comply with your rights_  
| _under the Texas Advance Directives Act if the physician, facility,_  
| _or committee is violating or threatening to violate a provision of_  
| _that Act. You may wish to talk to legal counsel for further_  
| _information about your right to seek a court order._  
|  *"Life-sustaining treatment" means treatment that, based on  
| reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and  
| without which the patient will die.  The term includes both  
| life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as  
| mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and  
| artificially administered nutrition and hydration.  The term does  
| not include the administration of pain management medication or the  
| performance of a medical procedure considered to be necessary to  
| provide comfort care, or any other medical care provided to  
| alleviate a patient's pain.

| may select another attending physician. The procedures _and_  
| _limitations_ established under Sections 166.045 _, 166.0455,_ and

| care decisions on behalf of a person, provided that if an attending  
| physician or health care facility is unwilling to honor _and comply_  
| _with_ a patient's advance directive or a treatment decision to  
| provide life-sustaining treatment _for a reason permitted by Section_  
| _166.046(a-1) and not prohibited by Section 166.0455_ ,  
| life-sustaining treatment is required to be provided the patient,

| transfer of the patient to another physician or health care  
| facility willing to comply with the advance directive or treatment  
| decision.

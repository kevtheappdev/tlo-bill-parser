|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the determination of whether a person is intoxicated  
| for purposes of the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 401.013(a) and (c), Labor Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In this subtitle, "intoxication" means the state of:  
|  (1) having an alcohol concentration to qualify as  
| intoxicated under Section 49.01(2), Penal Code; or  
|  (2) not having the normal use of mental or physical  
| faculties _by reason of_ [ ~~resulting from~~ ] the [ ~~voluntary~~ ]  
| introduction into the body of:  
|  (A) an alcoholic beverage, as defined by Section  
| 1.04, Alcoholic Beverage Code;  
|  (B) a controlled substance or controlled  
| substance analogue, as defined by Section 481.002, Health and  
| Safety Code;  
|  (C) a dangerous drug, as defined by Section  
| 483.001, Health and Safety Code;  
|  (D) an abusable _volatile chemical_ [ ~~glue or~~  
|  ~~aerosol paint~~ ], as defined by Section 485.001, Health and Safety  
| Code; or  
|  (E) any similar substance, the use of which is  
| regulated under state law.  
|  (c) _A_ [ ~~On the voluntary introduction into the body of any~~  
|  ~~substance listed under Subsection (a)(2)(B), based on a~~ ] blood test  
| or urinalysis _of a specimen taken not later than four hours_  
| _following an injury that shows the presence of a substance listed in_  
| _Subsection (a)(2) creates_ [ ~~, it is~~ ] a rebuttable presumption that a  
| person is intoxicated and does not have the normal use of mental or  
| physical faculties.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a claim for workers' compensation benefits based on a  
| compensable injury that occurs on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A claim based on a compensable injury that occurs before  
| that date is governed by the law as it existed on the date the  
| compensable injury occurred, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

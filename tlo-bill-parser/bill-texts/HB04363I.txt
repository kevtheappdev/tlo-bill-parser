|  AN ACT  
| relating to an increase in the state sales and use tax rate for the  
| purpose of reducing school district maintenance and operations ad  
| valorem taxes and a study of additional changes to the rate and  
| application of the state sales and use tax for that same purpose;  
| increasing the rate of a tax.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 151.051(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) The sales tax rate is _10.25_ [ ~~6-1/4~~ ] percent of the sales  
| price of the taxable item sold.  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter M, Chapter 151, Tax Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 151.803 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___151.803._ _____ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN REVENUE TO SCHOOL_  
| _DISTRICT PROPERTY TAX REDUCTION. Notwithstanding Section 151.801,_  
| _the comptroller shall deposit an amount of revenue equal to the_  
| _proceeds derived from the collection of taxes imposed by this_  
| _chapter attributable to the portion of the tax rate in excess of_  
| _6.25 percent of the sales price of the taxable item sold to the_  
| _credit of the property tax relief fund. Money credited to the fund_  
| _under this section may be appropriated only to reduce school_  
| _district maintenance and operations ad valorem tax rates in a_  
| _manner consistent with Section 403.109, Government Code._  
|  SECTION 3. (a) The comptroller of public accounts shall  
| study the rate of, and the exemptions, discounts, exclusions,  
| credits, and special reporting methods applicable to, the state  
| sales and use tax for the purpose of identifying alternative  
| sources of funding for public primary and secondary education in  
| this state other than local property taxes.  
|  (b) In the study, the comptroller must:  
|  (1) determine the intended purpose of each exemption,  
| discount, exclusion, credit, or special reporting method and  
| evaluate whether the exemption, discount, exclusion, credit, or  
| special reporting method achieves that purpose;  
|  (2) evaluate the effect of each exemption, discount,  
| exclusion, credit, or special reporting method on state revenue;  
| and  
|  (3) evaluate the rate at which the state sales and use  
| tax would need to be imposed to fully fund the cost of public  
| primary and secondary education in this state if:  
|  (A) each exemption, discount, exclusion, credit,  
| or special reporting method identified by the comptroller as  
| underperforming were repealed; and  
|  (B) school district maintenance and operations  
| ad valorem taxes were abolished.  
|  (c) Not later than November 1, 2020, the comptroller shall  
| prepare and deliver to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and  
| each member of the legislature a report of the findings of the  
| study.

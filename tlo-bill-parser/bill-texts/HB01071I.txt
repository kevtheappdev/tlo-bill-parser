|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to an advance directive and do-not-resuscitate order of a  
| pregnant woman and information provided for an advance directive.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 166.033, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 166.033. FORM OF WRITTEN DIRECTIVE. A written  
| directive may be in the following form:  
| DIRECTIVE TO PHYSICIANS AND FAMILY OR SURROGATES  
|  Instructions for completing this document:  
|  This is an important legal document known as an Advance  
| Directive. It is designed to help you communicate your wishes about  
| medical treatment at some time in the future when you are unable to  
| make your wishes known because of illness or injury. These wishes  
| are usually based on personal values. In particular, you may want  
| to consider what burdens or hardships of treatment you would be  
| willing to accept for a particular amount of benefit obtained if you  
| were seriously ill.  
|  You are encouraged to discuss your values and wishes with  
| your family or chosen spokesperson, as well as your physician. Your  
| physician, other health care provider, or medical institution may  
| provide you with various resources to assist you in completing your  
| advance directive. Brief definitions are listed below and may aid  
| you in your discussions and advance planning. Initial the  
| treatment choices that best reflect your personal preferences.  
| Provide a copy of your directive to your physician, usual hospital,  
| and family or spokesperson. Consider a periodic review of this  
| document. By periodic review, you can best assure that the  
| directive reflects your preferences.  
|  In addition to this advance directive, Texas law provides for  
| _three_ [ ~~two~~ ] other types of directives that can be important during a  
| serious illness. These are the Medical Power of Attorney _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] the  
| Out-of-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Order _, and the Health Care_  
| _Facility Do-Not-Resuscitate Order_. You may wish to discuss these  
| with your physician, family, hospital representative, or other  
| advisers. You may also wish to complete a directive related to the  
| donation of organs and tissues.  
| DIRECTIVE  
|  I, __________, recognize that the best health care is based  
| upon a partnership of trust and communication with my physician. My  
| physician and I will make health care or treatment decisions  
| together as long as I am of sound mind and able to make my wishes  
| known. If there comes a time that I am unable to make medical  
| decisions about myself because of illness or injury, I direct that  
| the following treatment preferences be honored:  
|  If, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with a  
| terminal condition from which I am expected to die within six  
| months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in  
| accordance with prevailing standards of medical care:  
|  | __________ | I request that all treatments other than those needed to
keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to
die as gently as possible; OR  
---|---  
|  | __________ | I request that I be kept alive in this terminal condition
using available life-sustaining treatment. (THIS SELECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO
HOSPICE CARE.)  
---|---  
| If, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with an  
| irreversible condition so that I cannot care for myself or make  
| decisions for myself and am expected to die without life-sustaining  
| treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of care:  
|  | __________ | I request that all treatments other than those needed to
keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to
die as gently as possible; OR  
---|---  
|  | __________ | I request that I be kept alive in this irreversible
condition using available life-sustaining treatment. (THIS SELECTION DOES NOT
APPLY TO HOSPICE CARE.)  
---|---  
|  _In case of pregnancy:_  
|  _If I am pregnant, my decision concerning life-sustaining_  
| _treatment is modified as follows:_  
|  | __________________________________________________________________  
---  
|  | __________________________________________________________________  
---  
|  | __________________________________________________________________  
---  
| _(THIS SECTION IS OPTIONAL, IS ONLY FOR WOMEN OF CHILD-BEARING AGE,_  
| _AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THIS FORM IF LEFT BLANK.)_  
|  Additional requests: (After discussion with your physician,  
| you may wish to consider listing particular treatments in this  
| space that you do or do not want in specific circumstances, such as  
| artificially administered nutrition and hydration, intravenous  
| antibiotics, etc. Be sure to state whether you do or do not want the  
| particular treatment.)  
|  After signing this directive, if my representative or I elect  
| hospice care, I understand and agree that only those treatments  
| needed to keep me comfortable would be provided and I would not be  
| given available life-sustaining treatments.  
|  If I do not have a Medical Power of Attorney, and I am unable  
| to make my wishes known, I designate the following person(s) to make  
| health care or treatment decisions with my physician compatible  
| with my personal values:  
|  1. __________  
|  2. __________  
|  (If a Medical Power of Attorney has been executed, then an  
| agent already has been named and you should not list additional  
| names in this document.)  
|  If the above persons are not available, or if I have not  
| designated a spokesperson, I understand that a spokesperson will be  
| chosen for me following standards specified in the laws of Texas.  
| If, in the judgment of my physician, my death is imminent within  
| minutes to hours, even with the use of all available medical  
| treatment provided within the prevailing standard of care, I  
| acknowledge that all treatments may be withheld or removed except  
| those needed to maintain my comfort. [ ~~I understand that under Texas~~  
|  ~~law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as~~  
|  ~~pregnant.~~ ] This directive will remain in effect until I revoke it.  
| No other person may do so.  
|  Signed__________ Date__________ City, County, State of  
| Residence __________  
|  Two competent adult witnesses must sign below, acknowledging  
| the signature of the declarant. The witness designated as Witness 1  
| may not be a person designated to make a health care or treatment  
| decision for the patient and may not be related to the patient by  
| blood or marriage. This witness may not be entitled to any part of  
| the estate and may not have a claim against the estate of the  
| patient. This witness may not be the attending physician or an  
| employee of the attending physician. If this witness is an employee  
| of a health care facility in which the patient is being cared for,  
| this witness may not be involved in providing direct patient care to  
| the patient. This witness may not be an officer, director, partner,  
| or business office employee of a health care facility in which the  
| patient is being cared for or of any parent organization of the  
| health care facility.  
|  Witness 1 __________ Witness 2 __________  
|  Definitions:  
|  "Artificially administered nutrition and hydration" means  
| the provision of nutrients or fluids by a tube inserted in a vein,  
| under the skin in the subcutaneous tissues, or in the  
| gastrointestinal tract.  
|  "Irreversible condition" means a condition, injury, or  
| illness:  
|  (1) that may be treated, but is never cured or  
| eliminated;  
|  (2) that leaves a person unable to care for or make  
| decisions for the person's own self; and  
|  (3) that, without life-sustaining treatment provided  
| in accordance with the prevailing standard of medical care, is  
| fatal.  
|  Explanation: Many serious illnesses such as cancer, failure  
| of major organs (kidney, heart, liver, or lung), and serious brain  
| disease such as Alzheimer's dementia may be considered irreversible  
| early on. There is no cure, but the patient may be kept alive for  
| prolonged periods of time if the patient receives life-sustaining  
| treatments. Late in the course of the same illness, the disease may  
| be considered terminal when, even with treatment, the patient is  
| expected to die. You may wish to consider which burdens of  
| treatment you would be willing to accept in an effort to achieve a  
| particular outcome. This is a very personal decision that you may  
| wish to discuss with your physician, family, or other important  
| persons in your life.  
|  "Life-sustaining treatment" means treatment that, based on  
| reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and  
| without which the patient will die. The term includes both  
| life-sustaining medications and artificial life support such as  
| mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and  
| artificially administered nutrition and hydration. The term does  
| not include the administration of pain management medication, the  
| performance of a medical procedure necessary to provide comfort  
| care, or any other medical care provided to alleviate a patient's  
| pain.  
|  "Terminal condition" means an incurable condition caused by  
| injury, disease, or illness that according to reasonable medical  
| judgment will produce death within six months, even with available  
| life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with the  
| prevailing standard of medical care.  
|  Explanation: Many serious illnesses may be considered  
| irreversible early in the course of the illness, but they may not be  
| considered terminal until the disease is fairly advanced. In  
| thinking about terminal illness and its treatment, you again may  
| wish to consider the relative benefits and burdens of treatment and  
| discuss your wishes with your physician, family, or other important  
| persons in your life.

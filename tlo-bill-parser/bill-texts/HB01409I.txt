|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the qualification of land for appraisal for ad valorem  
| tax purposes as timber land or restricted-use timber land.

|  SECTION 1. Section 23.72, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 23.72. QUALIFICATION FOR PRODUCTIVITY APPRAISAL. _(a)_  
| Land qualifies for appraisal as provided by this subchapter if it is  
| currently and actively devoted principally to production of timber  
| or forest products to the degree of intensity generally accepted in  
| the area with intent to produce income and has been devoted  
| principally to production of timber or forest products or to  
| agricultural use that would qualify the land for appraisal under  
| Subchapter C or D [ ~~of this chapter~~ ] for five of the preceding seven  
| years.  
|  _(b)_ _____In determining whether land is currently and actively_  
| _devoted principally to the production of timber or forest products_  
| _to the degree of intensity generally accepted in an area, a chief_  
| _appraiser may not consider the purpose for which a portion of a_  
| _parcel of land is used if the portion is:_  
|  _(1)_ _____used for a purpose associated with the production_  
| _of timber or forest products, including use as a road,_  
| _right-of-way, buffer area, or firebreak; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____subject to a right-of-way that was taken through_  
| _the exercise of the power of eminent domain._  
|  _(c)_ _____For the purpose of the appraisal of land under this_  
| _subchapter, a portion of a parcel of land described by Subsection_

| _has jurisdiction on the land if the portion of the land on which oil_  
| _and gas operations are not being conducted otherwise continues to_

|  _(2)_ _____subject to a right-of-way that was taken through_  
| _the exercise of the power of eminent domain._  
|  _(e)_ _____For the purpose of the appraisal of land under this_  
| _subchapter, a portion of a parcel of land described by Subsection_  
| _(d) is considered land that qualifies for appraisal under this_  
| _subchapter if the remainder of the parcel of land qualifies for_

| _end because a lessee under an oil and gas lease begins conducting_  
| _oil and gas operations over which the Railroad Commission of Texas_  
| _has jurisdiction on the land if the portion of the land on which oil_  
| _and gas operations are not being conducted otherwise continues to_  
| _qualify for appraisal under this subchapter._  
|  SECTION 5. (a)  Sections 23.72 and 23.9802, Tax Code, as

| valorem tax purposes for a tax year that begins on or after the  
| effective date of this Act.  
|  (b) Sections 23.765 and 23.9808, Tax Code, as added by this  
| Act, do not affect an additional tax imposed as a result of a change

|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide that  
| the appraised value of a residence homestead for ad valorem tax  
| purposes is the market value of the property for the first year that  
| the owner qualified the property for a homestead exemption or, if  
| the owner purchased the property, the purchase price of the  
| property is approved by the voters. If that amendment is not  
| approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

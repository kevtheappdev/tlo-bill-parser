|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the procedure by which information required to be  
| included in a notice of appraised value may be provided to a  
| property owner by the chief appraiser of an appraisal district.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 25.19, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (b-1), (b-2), (i), and (j) and adding Subsection (b-3)  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b-1) For real property, in addition to the information  
| required by Subsection (b), the chief appraiser shall state in a  
| notice required to be delivered under Subsection (a), the  
| difference, expressed as a percent increase or decrease, as  
| applicable, in the appraised value of the property for the current  
| tax year as compared to the fifth tax year before the current tax  
| year. _The chief appraiser may provide the information required by_  
| _this subsection by directing the property owner to the appraisal_  
| _district's Internet website, if applicable, from which the property_  
| _owner may access the information._  
|  (b-2) This subsection applies only to a notice of appraised  
| value for residential real property that has not qualified for a  
| residence homestead exemption in the current tax year. If the  
| records of the appraisal district indicate that the address of the  
| property is also the address of the owner of the property, in  
| addition to containing the applicable information required by  
| Subsections (b), (b-1), and (f), the notice must contain the  
| following statement in boldfaced 12-point type: "According to the  
| records of the appraisal district, the residential real property  
| described in this notice of appraised value is not currently being  
| allowed a residence homestead exemption from ad valorem taxation.  
| If the property is your home and you occupy it as your principal  
| place of residence, the property may qualify for one or more  
| residence homestead exemptions, which will reduce the amount of  
| taxes imposed on the property. The form needed to apply for a  
| residence homestead exemption is enclosed. Although the form may  
| state that the deadline for filing an application for a residence  
| homestead exemption is April 30, a late application for a residence  
| homestead exemption will be accepted if filed before February 1,  
| (insert year application must be filed). There is no fee or charge  
| for filing an application or a late application for a residence  
| homestead exemption." The notice must be accompanied by an  
| application form for a residence homestead exemption _or by a_  
| _statement directing the owner of the property to the appraisal_  
| _district's Internet website, if applicable, from which the owner_  
| _may access the form_.  
|  _(b-3)_ _____The chief appraiser may provide the information_  
| _required by Subsection (b)(5) by directing the property owner to_  
| _the appraisal district's Internet website, if applicable, from_  
| _which the property owner may access the information._  
|  (i) Delivery with a notice required by Subsection (a) or (g)  
| of a copy of the pamphlet published by the comptroller under Section  
| 5.06 or a copy of the notice published by the chief appraiser under  
| Section 41.70 _or direction to the comptroller's or appraisal_  
| _district's Internet website, if applicable, from which the property_  
| _owner may access the pamphlet_ is sufficient to comply with the  
| requirement that the notice include the information specified by  
| Subsection (b)(7) or (g)(3), as applicable.  
|  (j) The chief appraiser shall include with a notice required  
| by Subsection (a) or (g):  
|  (1) a copy of a notice of protest form as prescribed by  
| the comptroller under Section 41.44(d) _or a statement directing the_  
| _owner of the property to the comptroller's or appraisal district's_  
| _Internet website, if applicable, from which the owner may access_  
| _the form_ ; and  
|  (2) instructions for completing and mailing the form  
| to the appraisal review board and requesting a hearing on the  
| protest.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a notice of appraised value for a tax year beginning on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A notice of appraised value for a tax  
| year beginning before the effective date of this Act is governed by  
| the law in effect immediately before the effective date of this Act,  
| and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

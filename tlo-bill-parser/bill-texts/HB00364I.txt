|  ~~restricted operator~~ ].  
|  SECTION 5. Section 49.09(h), Penal Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (h) This subsection applies only to a person convicted of a  
| second or subsequent offense relating to the operating of a motor  
| vehicle while intoxicated committed within five years of the date

| shall enter an order that requires the defendant to have _an ignition_  
| _interlock_ [ ~~a~~ ] device installed, on each motor vehicle owned or  
| operated by the defendant, that uses a deep-lung breath analysis  
| mechanism to make impractical the operation of the motor vehicle if  
| ethyl alcohol is detected in the breath of the operator, and that  
| requires that before the first anniversary of the ending date of the  
| period of license suspension under Section 521.344, Transportation  
| Code, the defendant not operate any motor vehicle that is not  
| equipped with _an ignition interlock_ [ ~~that~~ ] device. The court shall

| defendant to provide evidence to the court on or before that ending  
| date that the _ignition interlock_ device has been installed on each  
| appropriate vehicle, and order the _ignition interlock_ device to

| order entered under this subsection is punishable by contempt. For  
| the purpose of enforcing this subsection, the court that enters an  
| order under this subsection retains jurisdiction over the defendant  
| until the date on which the _ignition interlock_ device is no longer  
| required to remain installed. _A court that restricts a defendant to_  
| _the operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition_  
| _interlock device under this subsection shall submit the name of the_  
| _defendant and the date the restriction expires to the Department of_  
| _Public Safety for inclusion in the central database maintained by_  
| _the department under Section 411.02091, Government Code._ To the

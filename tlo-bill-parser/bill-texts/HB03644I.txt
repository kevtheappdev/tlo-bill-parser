|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to transfer of irrigation water rights allowed by the  
| Edwards Aquifer Authority.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 1.34(c), Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd  
| Legislature, Regular Session, 1993, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) A permit holder may lease permitted water rights, but a  
| holder of a permit for irrigation use may not lease more than 50  
| percent of the irrigation rights initially permitted. The user's  
| remaining irrigation water rights must be used in accordance with  
| the original permit and must pass with transfer of the irrigated  
| land. _However, the authority by rule may establish a procedure by_  
| _which the holder of a permit for irrigation use, or his or her_  
| _assignor, may change the place or purpose of use of the irrigation_  
| _water right and sell or lease such right in the event circumstances_  
| _arise in which continued agricultural activities on the land are_  
| _substantially impaired._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 1.34, Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular Session,  
| 1993, applies only to a transfer, and the contracts or other  
| transaction documents of any kind related thereto, including  
| documents related to the extension of credit, hereinafter  
| collectively referred to as "transfer", effective on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. The change in law made by this Act to  
| Section 1.34, Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular  
| Session, 1993, does not affect the validity of a transfer effective  
| before the effective date of this Act. A transfer effective before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the provisions of  
| Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular Session, 1993,  
| and the rules of the Edwards Aquifer Authority in effect at the time  
| the transfer became effective. Transfers effective before the  
| effective date of this Act, that have not been rescinded, and are  
| not subject to pending litigation are hereby conclusively validated  
| in all respects.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

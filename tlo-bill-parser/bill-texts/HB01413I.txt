|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the language acquisition of children eight years of age  
| or younger who are deaf or hard of hearing.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The legislature finds that children who are deaf  
| or hard of hearing are often at risk for language delay or  
| deprivation. Research indicates that there is limited success in  
| addressing these issues after the optimal period for language  
| acquisition.  It is critical that the language acquisition of  
| children who are deaf or hard of hearing is closely monitored from  
| birth through age eight to enable the use of timely interventions  
| that support age-appropriate language skills.  Therefore, the  
| purpose of this Act is to generate and monitor data on the language  
| acquisition of children eight years of age or younger who are deaf  
| or hard of hearing by:  
|  (1) identifying language assessment protocols that  
| are appropriate for the development and age of each child; and  
|  (2) annually gathering and publishing relevant data.  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter I, Chapter 29, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 29.316 to read as follows:

|  _(b)_ _____The commissioner and the executive commissioner of the_  
| _Health and Human Services Commission jointly shall ensure that the_

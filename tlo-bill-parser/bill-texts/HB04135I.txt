| _used for a single-family short-term or long-term residential_  
| _purpose, regardless of whether it generates rental income for the_  
| _owner, is considered part of the residence homestead if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____there is only one such additional dwelling unit_  
| _located on the property that constitutes the owner's residence_  
| _homestead;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the municipality or county in which the property_

| _added in compliance with the program to encourage the use of such_  
| _dwelling units._

| that begins on or after the effective date of this Act.

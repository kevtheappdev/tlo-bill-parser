|  SECTION 1. Subchapter A, Chapter 533, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 533.00715 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___533.00715._ _____INDEPENDENT APPEALS PROCEDURE. (a) In_  
| _this section, "third-party arbiter" means a third-party medical_  
| _review organization that provides objective, unbiased medical_  
| _necessity determinations conducted by clinical staff with_  
| _education and practice in the same or similar practice area as the_  
| _procedure for which an independent determination of medical_  
| _necessity is sought._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission shall contract with at least three_  
| _independent, third-party arbiters to resolve recipient appeals of_

| _benefit determination or reduction in or denial of health care_  
| _services on the basis of medical necessity._  
|  _(c)_ _____The commission shall establish a common procedure for_  
| _appeals. The procedure must provide that a health care service_  
| _ordered by a health care provider is presumed medically necessary_  
| _and the commission or Medicaid managed care organization bears the_  
| _burden of proof to show the health care service is not medically_  
| _necessary. The commission shall also establish a procedure for_  
| _expedited appeals that allows a third-party arbiter to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____identify an appeal that requires an expedited_  
| _resolution; and_  
|  _(2) resolve the appeal within a specified period._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to Subsection (e), the commission shall ensure_  
| _an appeal is randomly assigned to a third-party arbiter._  
|  _(e)_ _____The commission shall ensure each third-party arbiter_  
| _has the necessary medical expertise to resolve an appeal._  
|  _(f)_ _____A third-party arbiter shall establish and maintain an_  
| _Internet portal through which a recipient may track the status and_  
| _final disposition of an appeal._  
|  _(g)_ _____A third-party arbiter shall educate recipients and_  
| _employees of Medicaid managed care organizations regarding appeals_  
| _processes, options, and proper and improper denials of health care_  
| _services on the basis of medical necessity._  
|  _(h)_ _____A third-party arbiter shall review aggregate denial_  
| _data categorized by Medicaid managed care plan to identify trends_  
| _and determine whether a Medicaid managed care organization is_  
| _disproportionately denying prior authorization requests from a_  
| _single provider or set of providers._  
|  SECTION 2. As soon as practicable after the effective date  
| of this Act, the executive commissioner of the Health and Human  
| Services Commission shall adopt the rules necessary to implement  
| this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

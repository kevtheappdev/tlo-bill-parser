|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to an increase in the amount of the exemption of residence  
| homesteads from ad valorem taxation by a school district, a  
| reduction in the amount of the limitation on school district ad  
| valorem taxes imposed on the residence homesteads of the elderly or  
| disabled to reflect the increased exemption amount, and the  
| protection of school districts against the resulting loss in local  
| revenue.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.13(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) An adult is entitled to exemption from taxation by a  
| school district of _$50,000_ [ ~~$25,000~~ ] of the appraised value of the  
| adult's residence homestead, except that only $5,000 of the  
| exemption applies to an entity operating under former Chapter 17,  
| 18, 25, 26, 27, or 28, Education Code, as those chapters existed on  
| May 1, 1995, as permitted by Section 11.301, Education Code.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 11.26(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) The tax officials shall appraise [ ~~the~~ ] property to which  
| this section applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but  
| if the tax [ ~~so~~ ] calculated exceeds the limitation imposed by this  
| section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this  
| section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  A school  
| district may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem tax  
| it imposes on the residence homestead of an individual 65 years of  
| age or older or on the residence homestead of an individual who is  
| disabled, as defined by Section 11.13, above the amount of the tax  
| it imposed in the first tax year in which the individual qualified  
| that residence homestead for the applicable exemption provided by  
| Section 11.13(c) for an individual who is 65 years of age or older  
| or is disabled.  If the individual qualified that residence  
| homestead for the exemption after the beginning of that first year  
| and the residence homestead remains eligible for the same exemption  
| for the next year, and if the school district taxes imposed on the  
| residence homestead in the next year are less than the amount of  
| taxes imposed in that first year, a school district may not  
| subsequently increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes  
| it imposes on the residence homestead above the amount it imposed in  
| the year immediately following the first year for which the  
| individual qualified that residence homestead for the same  
| exemption, except as provided by Subsection (b).  If the first tax  
| year the individual qualified the residence homestead for the  
| exemption provided by Section 11.13(c) for individuals 65 years of  
| age or older or disabled was a tax year before the _2021_ [ ~~2015~~ ] tax  
| year, the amount of the limitation provided by this section _for the_  
| _2021 tax year_ is the amount of tax the school district imposed for  
| the _2020_ [ ~~2014~~ ] tax year less an amount equal to the amount  
| determined by multiplying _$25,000_ [ ~~$10,000~~ ] times the tax rate of  
| the school district for the _2021_ [ ~~2015~~ ] tax year, plus any _2021_  
| [ ~~2015~~ ] tax attributable to improvements made in _2020_ [ ~~2014~~ ],
other  
| than improvements made to comply with governmental regulations or  
| repairs.

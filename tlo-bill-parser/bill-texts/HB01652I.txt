|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the public resale by means of a public auction using  
| online bidding and sale of property purchased by a taxing unit at an  
| ad valorem tax sale.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 34.05(d), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d) Except as provided by this subsection, all public sales  
| requested as provided by Subsection (c) _must_ [ ~~shall~~ ] be conducted  
| in the manner prescribed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for  
| the sale of property under execution _or, if directed by the_  
| _commissioners court of the county, in accordance with Section_  
| _34.01(a-1) and the rules adopted under that section providing for_  
| _public auction using online bidding and sale_. The notice of the sale  
| must contain a description of the property to be sold, the number  
| and style of the suit under which the property was sold at the tax  
| foreclosure sale, and the date of the tax foreclosure sale. The  
| description of the property in the notice is sufficient if it is  
| stated in the manner provided by Section 34.01(f). If the  
| commissioners court of a county by order specifies the date or time  
| at which or location in the county where a public sale requested  
| under Subsection (c) shall be conducted, the sale shall be  
| conducted on the date and at the time and location specified in the  
| order. The acceptance of a bid by the officer conducting the sale is  
| conclusive and binding on the question of its sufficiency. An  
| action to set aside the sale on the grounds that the bid is  
| insufficient may not be sustained in court, except that a taxing  
| unit that participates in distribution of proceeds of the sale may  
| file an action before the first anniversary of the date of the sale  
| to set aside the sale on the grounds of fraud or collusion between  
| the officer making the sale and the purchaser. On conclusion of the  
| sale, the officer making the sale shall prepare a deed to the  
| purchaser. The taxing unit that requested the sale may elect to  
| prepare a deed for execution by the officer. If the taxing unit  
| prepares the deed, the officer shall execute that deed. An officer  
| who executes a deed prepared by the taxing unit is not responsible  
| or liable for any inconsistency, error, or other defect in the form  
| of the deed. As soon as practicable after a deed is executed by the  
| officer, the officer shall either file the deed for recording with  
| the county clerk or deliver the executed deed to the taxing unit  
| that requested the sale, which shall file the deed for recording  
| with the county clerk. The county clerk shall file and record each  
| deed under this subsection and after recording shall return the  
| deed to the grantee.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the prosecution of the criminal offense of theft of  
| service.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 31.04, Penal Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (d-1) and adding Subsection (d-2) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d-1) _For purposes of Subsection (a)(3), the term "written_  
| _rental agreement"_ ___does not include an agreement that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____permits an individual to use personal property for_  
| _personal, family, or household purposes for an initial rental_  
| _period;_  
|  _(2)_ _____is automatically renewable with each payment after_  
| _the initial rental period; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____permits the individual to become the owner of the_  
| _property._  
|  _(d-2)_ For purposes of Subsection (a)(4):  
|  (1) if the compensation is or was to be paid on a  
| periodic basis, the intent to avoid payment for a service may be  
| formed at any time during or before a pay period; and  
|  (2) the partial payment of wages alone is not  
| sufficient evidence to negate the actor's intent to avoid payment  
| for a service.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred  
| before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a cause of action that accrues on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A cause of action that accrues before the effective date  
| of this Act is governed by the law in effect immediately before that  
| date, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as

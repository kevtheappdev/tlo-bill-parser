|  SECTION 2. Section 23.215, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 23.215. APPRAISAL OF CERTAIN NONEXEMPT PROPERTY USED  
| FOR LOW-INCOME OR MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING. (a) This section  
| applies only to real property owned by an organization:  
|  (1) _for the purpose of renting the property_ [ ~~that on~~  
|  ~~the effective date of this section was rented~~ ] to a low-income or  
| moderate-income individual or family satisfying the organization's  
| income eligibility requirements [ ~~and that continues to be used for~~  
|  ~~that purpose~~ ];  
|  (2) that was financed under the low income housing tax  
| credit program under Subchapter DD, Chapter 2306, Government Code _,_  
| _and is subject to a land use restriction agreement under that_  
| _subchapter that has not expired or been terminated_ ;  
|  (3) that does not receive an exemption under Section  
| 11.182 or 11.1825; and  
|  (4) the owner of which has not entered into an  
| agreement with any taxing unit to make payments to the taxing unit  
| instead of taxes on the property.  
|  (b) _In appraising property that is under construction or_  
| _that has not reached stabilized occupancy on January 1 of the tax_  
| _year in which the property is appraised, the_ [ ~~The~~ ] chief appraiser  
| shall _determine the appraised value of_ [ ~~appraise~~ ] the property in  
| the manner provided by Section 11.1825(q) _, provided that the chief_  
| _appraiser shall estimate the property's gross income potential and_  
| _operating expenses based on the property's projected income and_  
| _expenses for the first full year of operation as established and_  
| _utilized in the underwriting report pertaining to the property_  
| _prepared by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs_  
| _under Subchapter DD, Chapter 2306, Government Code, adjusted as_  
| _provided by this subsection. For a property under construction on_  
| _January 1, the income and expenses contained in the underwriting_  
| _report shall be adjusted by multiplying those amounts by a_  
| _fraction, the denominator of which is the total construction budget_  
| _for the property and the numerator of which is the total amount_  
| _spent in constructing the property as of January 1. For a property_  
| _on which construction was completed but that has not reached_  
| _stabilized occupancy on January 1, the income and expenses_  
| _contained in the underwriting report shall be adjusted to reflect_  
| _the actual occupancy of the property on January 1_.  
|  _(c)_ _____In appraising property for the first tax year following_  
| _the year in which construction on the property was completed and_  
| _occupancy of the property had stabilized, the chief appraiser shall_  
| _determine the appraised value of the property in the manner_  
| _provided by Section 11.1825(q)._  
|  _(d)_ _____In appraising property for the second and subsequent tax_  
| _years following the year in which construction on the property was_  
| _completed and occupancy of the property had stabilized, the chief_  
| _appraiser shall determine the appraised value of the property by_  
| _adjusting the appraised value of the property for the preceding tax_  
| _year by the percentage change in the net income of the property in_  
| _the preceding year as compared to the year preceding that year._  
|  _(d-1)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (d), for the 2020 tax_  
| _year, in appraising property for which construction was completed_  
| _on January 1, 2019, the chief appraiser shall determine the_  
| _appraised value of the property by adjusting the average appraised_  
| _value of the property for the preceding three-year period by the_  
| _percentage change in the net income of the property in the 2019 tax_  
| _year as compared to the 2018 tax year._ ___This subsection expires_  
| _January 1, 2021._  
|  _(e)_ _____If property appraised under this section is sold and is_  
| _no longer subject to a land use restriction agreement described by_  
| _Subsection (a)(2) after the sale, the property is no longer_  
| _eligible for appraisal under this section and an additional tax is_  
| _imposed on the property. The additional tax due is an amount equal_  
| _to the difference between the taxes imposed on the property for each_  
| _of the three years preceding the year in which the property is sold_  
| _that the property was appraised as provided by this section and the_  
| _taxes that would have been imposed had the property been appraised_  
| _in each of those years at the lesser of:_  
|  _(1) the price for which the property is sold; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the price for which the property is sold, adjusted_  
| _by the percentage change in the net income of the property for the_  
| _applicable year in the manner provided by Subsection (d)._  
|  _(f)_ _____A tax lien attaches to property to which Subsection (e)_  
| _applies on the date the property is sold to secure payment of the_  
| _additional tax imposed by that subsection. The lien exists in favor_  
| _of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed._  
|  _(g)_ _____A determination that property is no longer eligible for_  
| _appraisal under this section is made by the chief appraiser._ _____The_  
| _chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the_  
| _owner of the property as soon as possible after making the_  
| _determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the_  
| _owner's right to protest the determination._ _____If the owner does not_  
| _file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest_  
| _is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing_  
| _unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes as_  
| _soon as practicable._ _____The taxes are due and become delinquent and_  
| _incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes_

| _that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the_  
| _owner of the property._

|  _(1)_ _____a property owner may not bring a protest under_  
| _Section 41.41(a)(2) alleging unequal appraisal of the owner's_  
| _property on the ground of the appraised value of the property being_  
| _greater than the median appraised value of a reasonable number of_  
| _comparable properties appropriately adjusted for any tax year in_  
| _which the appraised value of the property is determined as provided_  
| _by this section; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a property appraised as provided by this section_  
| _may not be used as a comparable property for the purpose of_  
| _determining whether another property that is not appraised as_  
| _provided by this section is unequally appraised._  
|  _(i)_ _____For purposes of this section, the chief appraiser, in_  
| _determining the percentage change in the net income of property:_  
|  _(1)_ _____shall use generally accepted appraisal methods and_  
| _techniques to determine the property's operating expenses based on_  
| _information contained in:_  
|  _(A)_ _____an audit of the organization that owns the_  
| _property prepared by an independent auditor covering the relevant_  
| _fiscal period; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____the most recent annual owner's compliance_  
| _report filed by the organization that owns the property with the_  
| _Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____may not consider the taxes imposed on the property_  
| _and paid by the organization that owns the property to be an_  
| _operating expense of the property._  
|  _(j)_ _____Not later than May 1 of each year, the owner of a_  
| _property appraised under this section shall provide to the chief_  
| _appraiser of the appraisal district that appraises the property a_  
| _copy of the document described by Subsection (i)(1)(A) or (B), as_  
| _applicable. The chief appraiser may extend the deadline provided_  
| _by this subsection for good cause shown._

| to an ad valorem tax year that begins on or after January 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the extent of a defendant's criminal responsibility for  
| the conduct of a coconspirator in a capital murder case.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 7.02(b), Penal Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) If, in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit  
| one felony, another felony is committed by one of the conspirators,  
| all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed,  
| though having no intent to commit it, _provided that_ [ ~~if~~ ] the offense  
| was committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose and was one  
| that should have been anticipated as a result of the carrying out of  
| the conspiracy. _This subsection does not apply to the prosecution_  
| _of the offense of capital murder._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the prosecution of an offense committed on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. The prosecution of an offense committed before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the offense was committed, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose. For purposes of this section, an offense  
| was committed before the effective date of this Act if any element  
| of the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

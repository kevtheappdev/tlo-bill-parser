|  ~~after~~ ] the date a final judgment is entered in a bond forfeiture  
| proceeding, the surety on the bond may file with the court a special  
| bill of review. A special bill of review may include a request, on  
| equitable grounds, that the final judgment be reformed and that all  
| or part of the bond amount be remitted to the surety, after  
| deducting the costs of court, any reasonable costs to the county for  
| the return of the principal, and the interest accrued on the bond  
| amount from the date of forfeiture. The court in its discretion may  
| grant or deny the bill in whole or in part.

| amended by this Act, applies only to a bail bond for which a final  
| judgment of forfeiture is entered on or after the effective date of

| entered before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the judgment was entered, and the former law  
| is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

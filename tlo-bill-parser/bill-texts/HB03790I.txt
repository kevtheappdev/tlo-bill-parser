|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to judicial review of certain regulations that apply to  
| state licensees.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the Regulations with  
| Economic Impact in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.  
|  SECTION 2. Title 2, Occupations Code, is amended by adding  
| Chapter 60 to read as follows:  
| _CHAPTER 60. REGULATIONS WITH ECONOMIC IMPACT IN NEED OF SCRUTINY_  
|  _Sec._ ___60.001._ _____PURPOSE OF CHAPTER. It is the purpose of this_  
| _chapter to provide a judicial remedy to ensure that a state licensee_  
| _has the right to engage in an occupation or business activity_  
| _authorized by and regulated under state law without burdensome or_  
| _inconsistent local regulation of the state licensee's occupation or_  
| _lawful business activities._  
|  _Sec. 60.002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Local regulation" means any ordinance, rule, or_  
| _regulation adopted by the governing body of a municipality that_  
| _establishes requirements for, imposes restrictions on, or_  
| _otherwise regulates the business activity of a state licensee_  
| _within the municipality or the municipality's extraterritorial_  
| _jurisdiction._  
|  _(2)_ _____"State licensee" means a person or entity that,_  
| _under state law, in order to practice the person's occupation or_  
| _conduct the entity's business in this state, is required to obtain a_  
| _license, permit, registration certificate, or other evidence of_  
| _authority from, and is subject to regulation by, a state licensing_  
| _authority._  
|  _(3)_ _____"State licensing authority" means a state agency,_  
| _department, board, or commission or the executive or administrative_  
| _officer of a state agency, department, board, or commission._  
|  _Sec._ ___60.003._ _____SUIT TO ENJOIN ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL_  
| _REGULATION. (a)_ _____A suit to enjoin enforcement of a local_  
| _regulation may be brought by a state licensee that is subject to the_  
| _local regulation if the local regulation:_  
|  _(1)_ _____establishes requirements for, imposes_  
| _restrictions on, or otherwise regulates the business activity of_  
| _the state licensee in a manner that is more stringent than the_  
| _requirements, restrictions, and regulations imposed on the state_  
| _licensee under state law; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____would result in an adverse economic impact on the_  
| _state licensee._  
|  _(b)_ _____A suit under this chapter must be brought in a district_  
| _court:_  
|  _(1)_ _____for a judicial district in which any portion of the_  
| _territory of the municipality that adopted the local regulation is_  
| _located; or_  
|  _(2) in Travis County._  
|  _(c)_ _____In a suit under this chapter, the state licensee must_  
| _show by a preponderance of the evidence that the local regulation_  
| _substantially burdens the state licensee's right to engage in an_  
| _occupation authorized by and regulated under state law or would_  
| _result in an adverse economic impact on the state licensee. In a_  
| _suit under this chapter, the state licensee may submit evidence_  
| _regarding the adverse economic impact of similar local regulations_  
| _in other jurisdictions inside or outside the state._  
|  _(d)_ _____If the state licensee meets the preponderance of the_  
| _evidence burden required by Subsection (c), the municipality has_  
| _the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that_  
| _the local regulation the municipality seeks to enforce:_  
|  _(1) does not conflict with state law; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____is necessary and narrowly tailored to protect_  
| _against actual and specific harm to the public health or safety._  
|  _(e)_ _____The district court may grant any prohibitory or_  
| _mandatory relief warranted by the facts, including a temporary_  
| _restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction._  
|  _(f)_ _____If a state licensee prevails in a suit brought under_  
| _this chapter, the court shall award the state licensee court costs_  
| _and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees to be paid by the_  
| _municipality._  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

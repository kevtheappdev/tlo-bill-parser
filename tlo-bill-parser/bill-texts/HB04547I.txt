|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to requiring a consumer warning upon sale of certain  
| household plants that are hazardous when ingested by canines.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. This Act shall be known as Rudy's Law.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 71.057 of the Agriculture Code is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 71.057. NURSERY DEALERS AND AGENTS; ANNUAL  
| REGISTRATION; _REQUIRED WARNING TO CONSUMERS_.  (a)  A person who buys  
| and sells or leases or offers for sale or lease a nursery product  
| and who has facilities that maintain or preserve the nursery  
| product and prevent that product from becoming dry, infested, or  
| diseased is a nursery dealer.  
|  (b) A person is a nursery agent if the person sells or  
| leases, offers for sale or lease, or takes mail orders for the sale  
| or lease of a nursery product and:  
|  (1) is entirely under the control of a nursery grower  
| or nursery dealer with whom the nursery product offered for sale or  
| lease originates; or  
|  (2) operates on a cooperative basis for handling a  
| nursery product with a nursery grower or nursery dealer.  
|  (c) A nursery agent shall possess proper credentials from  
| the nursery grower or nursery dealer the agent represents or  
| cooperates with. A nursery agent who fails to possess proper  
| credentials is subject to this subchapter as a nursery dealer.  
|  (d) A nursery dealer or nursery agent must register with the  
| department under this section before offering for sale or lease or  
| otherwise distributing a nursery product.  
|  (e) A nursery dealer or nursery agent may apply for  
| registration or renewal of registration by submitting an  
| application prescribed by the department and an annual fee. The fee  
| shall be the sum of:  
|  (1) an amount based on the size and type of a location,  
| as defined by department rule, where a nursery dealer or nursery  
| agent offers a nursery product for sale or lease; and  
|  (2) an optional additional amount equal to 15 percent  
| of the amount described by Subdivision (1), to fund the Texas  
| nursery and floral account.  
|  (e-1) The department shall allow an applicant to elect  
| whether to pay the amount described by Subsection (e)(2).  An  
| applicant is not required to pay that amount to apply for or renew  
| registration.  
|  (f) Registrations under this section expire one year after  
| issuance. A person who fails to submit a renewal fee on or before  
| the expiration date of the registration must pay, in addition to the  
| renewal fee, the late fee provided by Section 12.024 of this code.  
|  (g) Upon receipt of the correct annual registration fee, the  
| department shall issue a registration certificate for each location  
| a florist or nursery owner has registered.  
|  _(h)_ _____A nursery dealer or nursery agent must include a written_  
| _statement upon the sale of any species of plant containing cycasin,_  
| _warning the end user of such plant that the ingestion of the plant_  
| _by canines can be harmful or fatal._  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

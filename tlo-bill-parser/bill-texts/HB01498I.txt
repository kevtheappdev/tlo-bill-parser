| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A person commits an offense if:  
|  (1) during a period that is 30 or more days in duration  
| _and regardless of whether the acts are committed against one or more_

|  (2) at the time of the commission of each of the acts  
| of sexual abuse, the actor is 17 years of age or older and the victim  
| is a child younger than 14 years of age, regardless of whether the  
| actor knows the age of the victim at the time of the offense.  
|  (c) For purposes of this section, "act of sexual abuse"  
| means any act that is a violation of _:_  
|  _(1)_ one or more of the following penal laws _of this_  
| _state_ :

| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense was  
| committed before that date.

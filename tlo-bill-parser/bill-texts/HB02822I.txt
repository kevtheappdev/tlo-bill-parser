|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 342.201(e), Finance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (e) A loan contract under this chapter that is not secured  
| by real property may provide for a rate or amount of interest  
| computed using the true daily earnings method or the scheduled  
| installment earnings method that does not exceed:  
|  (1) _36_ [ ~~30~~ ] percent a year on that part of the cash  
| advance that is less than or equal to the amount computed under  
| Subchapter C, Chapter 341, using the reference base amount of $500;  
|  (2) 24 percent a year on that part of the cash advance  
| that is more than the amount computed for Subdivision (1) but less  
| than or equal to an amount computed under Subchapter C, Chapter 341,  
| using the reference base amount of $1,050; and  
|  (3) 18 percent a year on that part of the cash advance  
| that is more than the amount computed for Subdivision (2) but less  
| than or equal to an amount computed under Subchapter C, Chapter 341,  
| using the reference base amount of $2,500.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 342.251, Finance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 342.251. MAXIMUM CASH ADVANCE. The maximum cash  
| advance of a loan made under this subchapter is an amount computed  
| under Subchapter C, Chapter 341, using the reference base amount of  
| $100, except that for loans that are subject to Section 342.259 the  
| reference base amount is _$300_ [ ~~$200~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Section 342.259(a), Finance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) Instead of the charges authorized by Sections 342.201  
| and 342.252, a loan made under this subchapter with a maximum cash  
| advance computed under Subchapter C, Chapter 341, using a reference  
| base amount that is more than $100 but not more than _$300_ [ ~~$200~~ ],  
| may provide for:  
|  (1) an acquisition charge that is not more than $10;  
| and  
|  (2) an installment account handling charge that is not  
| more than the ratio of $4 a month for each $100 of cash advance.  
|  SECTION 4. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a loan made on or after the effective date of this Act. A loan made  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect on the date the loan was made, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose. For purposes of this section,  
| a refinance or renewal of a loan is considered made on the date the  
| loan being refinanced or renewed was made.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

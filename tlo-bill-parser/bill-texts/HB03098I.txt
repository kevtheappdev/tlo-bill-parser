|  ~~practices, the board of directors of an appraisal district shall~~  
|  ~~develop biennially a written plan for the periodic reappraisal of~~  
|  ~~all property within the boundaries of the district according to the~~

| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 6.06. APPRAISAL _OFFICE_ [ ~~DISTRICT~~ ] BUDGET AND  
| FINANCING.  
|  SECTION 10. Sections 6.06(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h),  
| (i), (j), and (k), Tax Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Each year the _county assessor-collector who governs an_  
| _appraisal office, with the assistance of the_ chief appraiser _,_ shall  
| prepare a proposed budget for the operations of the _office_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] for the following tax year and shall submit copies to  
| each taxing unit participating in the _office_ [ ~~district and to the~~  
|  ~~district board of directors~~ ] before June 15. _The budget must_ [
~~He~~  
|  ~~shall~~ ] include [ ~~in the budget~~ ] a list showing each proposed  
| position, the proposed salary for the position, all benefits  
| proposed for the position, each proposed capital expenditure, and  
| an estimate of the amount of the budget that will be allocated to  
| each taxing unit. Each taxing unit [ ~~entitled to vote on the~~  
|  ~~appointment of board members~~ ] shall maintain a copy of the proposed  
| budget for public inspection at its principal administrative  
| office.  
|  (b) The _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board of directors~~ ]  
| shall hold a public hearing to consider the budget. The _chief_  
| _appraiser_ [ ~~secretary of the board~~ ] shall deliver to the presiding  
| officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in  
| the _appraisal office_ [ ~~district~~ ] not later than the 10th day before  
| the date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and  
| place fixed for the hearing. The _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board~~ ]  
| shall complete _the_ [ ~~its~~ ] hearings, make any amendments to the  
| proposed budget [ ~~it desires~~ ], and finally approve a budget before  
| September 15. If _the_ governing bodies of a majority of the taxing  
| units _participating in the appraisal office_ [ ~~entitled to vote on~~  
|  ~~the appointment of board members~~ ] adopt resolutions disapproving a  
| budget and file them with the _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~secretary~~  
|  ~~of the board~~ ] within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not  
| take effect, and the _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board~~ ] shall adopt  
| a new budget within 30 days of the disapproval.  
|  (c) The _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board~~ ] may amend the  
| approved budget at any time[ ~~,~~ ] but [ ~~the secretary of the board~~ ]
must  
| deliver a written copy of a proposed amendment to the presiding  
| officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in  
| the _appraisal office_ [ ~~district~~ ] not later than the 30th day before  
| the date the _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board~~ ] acts on it.  
|  (d) Each taxing unit participating in the _appraisal office_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] is allocated a portion of the amount of the budget equal  
| to the proportion that the total dollar amount of property taxes  
| imposed in the _county for which the office is established_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] by the _taxing_ unit for the tax year in which the budget  
| proposal is prepared bears to the sum of the total dollar amount of  
| property taxes imposed in the _county_ [ ~~district~~ ] by each  
| participating _taxing_ unit for that year. If a taxing unit  
| participates in two or more _appraisal offices_ [ ~~districts~~ ], only the  
| taxes imposed in _the appropriate county_ [ ~~a district~~ ] are used to  
| calculate the _taxing_ unit's cost allocations in that _office_  
| [ ~~district~~ ]. If the number of real property parcels in a taxing unit  
| is less than 5 percent of the total number of real property parcels  
| in the _county_ [ ~~district~~ ] and the taxing unit imposes in excess of 25  
| percent of the total amount of the property taxes imposed in the  
| _county_ [ ~~district~~ ] by all of the participating taxing units for a  
| year, the _taxing_ unit's allocation may not exceed a percentage of  
| the appraisal _office's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] budget equal to three times the  
| _taxing_ unit's percentage of the total number of real property  
| parcels appraised by the _office_ [ ~~district~~ ].  
|  (f) Payments shall be made to a depository designated by the  
| _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~district board of directors~~ ]. The  
| _appraisal office's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] funds may be disbursed only by a  
| written check, draft, or order signed by the _county_  
| _assessor-collector_ [ ~~chairman and secretary of the board~~ ] or, if  
| authorized by [ ~~resolution of~~ ] the _county assessor-collector_  
| [ ~~board~~ ], by the chief appraiser.  
|  (g) If a taxing unit decides not to impose taxes for any tax  
| year, the _taxing_ unit is not liable for any of the costs of  
| operating the _appraisal office_ [ ~~district~~ ] in that year, and those  
| costs are allocated among the other taxing units as if that _taxing_  
| unit had not imposed taxes in the year used to calculate  
| allocations. However, if that _taxing_ unit has made any payments, it  
| is not entitled to a refund.  
|  (h) If a newly formed taxing unit or a taxing unit that did  
| not impose taxes in the preceding year imposes taxes in any tax  
| year, that _taxing_ unit is allocated a portion of the amount budgeted  
| to operate the _appraisal office_ [ ~~district~~ ] as if it had imposed  
| taxes in the preceding year, except that the amount of taxes the  
| _taxing_ unit imposes in the current year is used to calculate its  
| allocation. Before the amount of taxes to be imposed for the  
| current year is known, the allocation may be based on an estimate to  
| which the _county assessor-collector who governs the appraisal_  
| _office_ [ ~~district board of directors~~ ] and the governing body of the  
| _taxing_ unit agree, and the payments made after that amount is known  
| shall be adjusted to reflect the amount imposed. The payments of a  
| newly formed taxing unit that has no source of funds are postponed  
| until the _taxing_ unit has received adequate tax or other revenues.  
|  (i) The fiscal year of an appraisal _office_ [ ~~district~~ ] is the  
| calendar year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the  
| taxing units _that participate in the office_ [ ~~entitled to vote on the~~  
|  ~~appointment of board members~~ ] adopt resolutions proposing a  
| different fiscal year and file them with the _county_  
| _assessor-collector who governs the office_ [ ~~secretary of the board~~ ]  
| not more than 12 and not less than eight months before the first day  
| of the fiscal year proposed by the resolutions. If the fiscal year  
| of an appraisal _office_ [ ~~district~~ ] is changed under this subsection,  
| the _county assessor-collector, with the assistance of the_ chief  
| appraiser _,_ shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year as  
| provided by Subsection (a) [ ~~of this section~~ ] before the 15th day of  
| the seventh month preceding the first day of the fiscal year  
| established by the change, and the _county assessor-collector_ [ ~~board~~  
|  ~~of directors~~ ] shall adopt a budget for the fiscal year as provided  
| by Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ] before the 15th day of the  
| fourth month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established  
| by the change. _The_ [ ~~Unless the appraisal district adopts a~~  
|  ~~different method of allocation under Section 6.061 of this code,~~  
|  ~~the~~ ] allocation of the budget to each taxing unit shall be  
| calculated as provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] using  
| the amount of property taxes imposed by each participating taxing  
| unit in the most recent tax year preceding the fiscal year  
| established by the change for which the necessary information is  
| available. Each taxing unit shall pay its allocation as provided by  
| Subsection (e) [ ~~of this section~~ ], except that the first payment  
| shall be made before the first day of the fiscal year established by  
| the change and subsequent payments shall be made quarterly. In the  
| year in which a change in the fiscal year occurs, the budget that  
| takes effect on January 1 of that year may be amended as necessary  
| as provided by Subsection (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ] in order to  
| accomplish the change in fiscal years.  
|  (j) If the total amount of the payments made or due to be  
| made by the taxing units participating in an appraisal _office_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] exceeds the amount actually spent or obligated to be  
| spent during the fiscal year for which the payments were made, the  
| chief appraiser shall credit the excess amount against each taxing  
| unit's allocated payments for the following year in proportion to  
| the amount of each _taxing_ unit's budget allocation for the fiscal  
| year for which the payments were made. If a taxing unit that paid  
| its allocated amount is not allocated a portion of the _appraisal_  
| _office's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] budget for the following fiscal year, the  
| chief appraiser shall refund to the taxing unit its proportionate  
| share of the excess funds not later than the 150th day after the end  
| of the fiscal year for which the payments were made.  
|  (k) For good cause shown, the _county assessor-collector who_  
| _governs an appraisal office_ [ ~~board of directors~~ ] may waive the  
| penalty and interest on a delinquent payment under Subsection (e).  
|  SECTION 11. Sections 6.062(a) and (c), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Not later than the 10th day before the date of the public  
| hearing at which the _county assessor-collector who governs an_  
| _appraisal office_ [ ~~board of directors~~ ] considers the appraisal  
| _office_ [ ~~district~~ ] budget, the chief appraiser shall give notice of  
| the public hearing by publishing the notice in a newspaper having

| election in the _county for which the_ appraisal _office is_  
| _established_ [ ~~district~~ ] or _in the_ taxing unit on the question of  
| consolidation of assessing or collecting functions or both;  
|  (2) it states the functions to be consolidated and

|  (b) _The chief appraiser_ [ ~~If a taxing unit authorizes a~~

|  ~~reappraisal of that territory~~ ] imposed in _that territory in_ the  
| preceding year.  
|  (d) If property damaged in a disaster is reappraised _for a_  
| _taxing unit_ as provided by this section, the governing body _of the_  
| _taxing unit_ shall provide for prorating the taxes on the property  
| for the year in which the disaster occurred.  _The_ [ ~~If the taxes are~~ ]  
| prorated[ ~~,~~ ] taxes due on the property are determined as follows:  
| the taxes on the property based on its value on January 1 of that  
| year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365  
| and the numerator of which is the number of days before the date the  
| disaster occurred; the taxes on the property based on its  
| reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of  
| which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days,

| has never been occupied as a residence and is held for sale in the  
| ordinary course of a trade or business, provided that the

| elect to have the inventory appraised at its market value as of

| appraisal applies by filing an application with the chief appraiser  
| requesting that the inventory be appraised as of September 1. The  
| application must clearly describe the inventory to which it applies  
| and be signed by the owner of the inventory. The application  
| applies to the appraisal of the inventory in each tax year that  
| begins after the next August 1 following the date the application is

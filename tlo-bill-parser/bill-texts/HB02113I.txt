| question that is being field-tested and was not used to compute the  
| student's score on the instrument. The agency shall also release,  
| under board rule, each question that is no longer being

|  ~~agency in a manner prescribed by the commissioner~~ ].  
|  (h) _Except as provided by Subsection (g), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] agency  
| shall notify school districts and campuses of the results of

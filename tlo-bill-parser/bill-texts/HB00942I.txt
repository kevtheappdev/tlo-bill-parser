|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the creation and duties of the Global Climate Change  
| Commission.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. STATEMENT OF POLICY. (a)  There is broad  
| agreement between nations, across states, and among scientists that  
| increasing emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other  
| greenhouse gases released into the earth's atmosphere are affecting  
| the earth's climate.  
|  (b) There is further consensus that global climate change,  
| national security, and energy dependence are a related set of  
| global challenges.  
|  (c) The potential adverse effects of global climate change  
| in the coming decades include extreme weather events, drought, a  
| decline in air quality, rising sea levels and global temperatures,  
| and exacerbation of challenges such as infectious disease and  
| terrorism.  
|  (d) The state of the world's climate in the future largely  
| depends on how global leaders react to global climate change now.  
|  (e) Many states and countries have reached across borders to  
| collaborate and develop policies to reduce greenhouse gas  
| emissions, spur private investment in clean energy, and enhance  
| energy security.  
|  (f) By not taking aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gas  
| emissions, this state is missing out on an opportunity to become a  
| global leader in protecting against global climate change and risks  
| exposing the state's economy and its citizens to unmitigated  
| consequences.  
|  (g) Global warming will have deleterious effects on the  
| state's labor productivity, infrastructure, and industries,  
| including agriculture, water, energy, forestry, and tourism.  
|  (h) Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as  
| energy conservation and development of renewable energy sources,  
| may have multiple benefits, including economic development, job  
| creation, cost savings, and improved air quality in and beyond the  
| boundaries of this state.  
|  (i) Recognizing the potential threat to the environment,  
| economy, and national security, it is the intent of the Texas  
| Legislature to create a global climate change commission committed  
| to working toward mitigating the impacts of global climate change  
| nationally and internationally.  
|  SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act:  
|  (1) "Commission" means the Global Climate Change  
| Commission.  
|  (2) "Greenhouse gas" has the meaning assigned by  
| Section 403.028, Government Code.  
|  (3) "Institution of higher education" has the meaning

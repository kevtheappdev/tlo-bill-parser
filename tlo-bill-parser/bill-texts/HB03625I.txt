|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the assignment of performance ratings under the public  
| school accountability system.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 39.054(a), (a-1), (a-2), and (b),  
| Education Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules to evaluate school  
| district and campus performance and assign each district and campus  
| an overall performance rating _and_ [ ~~of A, B, C, D, or F. In addition~~  
|  ~~to the overall performance rating, the commissioner shall assign~~  
|  ~~each district and campus~~ ] a separate domain performance rating [
~~of~~  
|  ~~A, B, C, D, or F~~ ] for each domain under Section 39.053(c)[ ~~. An~~  
|  ~~overall or domain performance rating~~ ] of [ ~~A reflects~~ ] exemplary  
| performance _,_ [ ~~. An overall or domain performance rating of B~~  
|  ~~reflects~~ ] recognized performance _,_ [ ~~. An overall or domain~~  
|  ~~performance rating of C reflects~~ ] acceptable performance _,_ [ ~~.
An~~  
|  ~~overall or domain performance rating of D reflects~~ ] performance  
| that needs improvement _,_ [ ~~. An overall~~ ] or [ ~~domain performance
rating~~  
|  ~~of F reflects~~ ] unacceptable performance. A district may not receive  
| an overall or domain performance rating of _exemplary performance_  
| [ ~~A~~ ] if the district includes any campus with a corresponding  
| overall or domain performance rating of _performance that needs_  
| _improvement or unacceptable performance_ [ ~~D or F~~ ]. If a school  
| district has been approved under Section 39.0544 to assign campus  
| performance ratings and the commissioner has not assigned a campus  
| an overall performance rating of _performance that needs improvement_  
| _or unacceptable performance_ [ ~~D or F~~ ], the commissioner shall assign  
| the campus an overall performance rating based on the school  
| district assigned performance rating under Section 39.0544. A  
| reference in law to an acceptable rating or acceptable performance  
| includes an overall or domain performance rating of [ ~~A, B, C, or D~~  
|  ~~or~~ ] performance that is exemplary, recognized, or acceptable  
| performance or performance that needs improvement.  
|  (a-1) For purposes of assigning an overall performance  
| rating for a district or campus under Subsection (a), the  
| commissioner shall:  
|  (1) consider either the district's or campus's  
| performance rating under the student achievement domain under  
| Section 39.053(c)(1) or the school progress domain under Section  
| 39.053(c)(2), whichever performance rating is higher, unless the  
| district or campus received a performance rating of _unacceptable_  
| _performance_ [ ~~F~~ ] in either domain, in which case the district or  
| campus may not be assigned a performance rating higher than  
| _recognized performance_ [ ~~a B~~ ] for the composite for the two domains;  
| and  
|  (2) attribute not less than 30 percent of the  
| performance rating to the closing the gaps domain under Section  
| 39.053(c)(3).  
|  (a-2) The commissioner by rule may adopt procedures to  
| ensure that a repeated performance rating of _performance that needs_  
| _improvement_ [ ~~D or F~~ ] or unacceptable _performance_ in one domain,  
| particularly performance that is not significantly improving, is  
| reflected in the overall performance rating of a district or campus  
| under this section or a campus under Section 39.0544 and is not  
| compensated for by a performance rating of _exemplary, recognized,_  
| _or acceptable performance_ [ ~~A, B, or C~~ ] in another domain.  
|  (b) For purposes of assigning school districts and campuses  
| an overall and a domain performance rating under Subsection (a),  
| the commissioner shall ensure that the method used to evaluate  
| performance is implemented in a manner that provides the  
| mathematical possibility that all districts and campuses receive an  
| _exemplary performance_ [ ~~A~~ ] rating.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 39.0544(a) and (e), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules regarding the  
| assignment of campus performance ratings by school districts and  
| open-enrollment charter schools. The rules:  
|  (1) must require a district or school, in assigning an  
| overall performance rating for a campus, to incorporate:  
|  (A) domain performance ratings assigned by the  
| commissioner under Section 39.054; and  
|  (B) performance ratings based on locally  
| developed domains or sets of accountability measures;  
|  (2) may permit a district or school to assign weights  
| to each domain or set of accountability measures described in  
| Subdivision (1), as determined by the district or school, provided  
| that the domains specified in Subdivision (1)(A) must in the  
| aggregate account for at least 50 percent of the overall  
| performance rating;  
|  (3) must require that each locally developed domain or  
| set of accountability measures:  
|  (A) contains levels of performance that allow for  
| differentiation, with assigned standards for achieving the  
| differentiated levels;  
|  (B) provides for the assignment of a _performance_  
| _rating of exemplary performance, recognized performance,_  
| _acceptable performance, performance that needs improvement, or_  
| _unacceptable performance_ [ ~~letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F~~ ]; and  
|  (C) meets standards for reliability and  
| validity;  
|  (4) must require that calculations for overall  
| performance ratings and each locally developed domain or set of  
| accountability measures be capable of being audited by a third  
| party;  
|  (5) must require that a district or school produce a  
| campus score card that may be displayed on the agency's website; and  
|  (6) must require that a district or school develop and  
| make available to the public an explanation of the methodology used  
| to assign performance ratings under this section.  
|  (e) A school district or open-enrollment charter school  
| authorized under this section to assign campus performance ratings  
| shall evaluate the performance of each campus as provided by this  
| section and assign each campus a performance rating of _exemplary_  
| _performance, recognized performance, acceptable performance,_  
| _performance that needs improvement, or unacceptable performance_  
| [ ~~A, B, C, D, or F~~ ] for overall performance and for each locally  
| developed domain or set of accountability measures. Not later than  
| a date established by the commissioner, the district or school  
| shall:  
|  (1) report the performance ratings to the agency; and  
|  (2) make the performance ratings available to the  
| public as provided by commissioner rule.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 39.101, Education Code, as added by  
| Chapter 807 (H.B. 22), Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular  
| Session, 2017, is transferred to Subchapter B, Chapter 39A,  
| Education Code, redesignated as Section 39A.0545, Education Code,  
| amended to conform to the repeal of Subchapter E, Chapter 39,  
| Education Code, by Article 21, Chapter 324 (S.B. 1488), Acts of the  
| 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, and further amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. _39A.0545_ [ ~~39.101~~ ]. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT _PERFORMANCE_  
| RATING. (a)  Notwithstanding any other law, if a school district or  
| campus is assigned an overall or domain performance rating of  
| _performance that needs improvement_ [ ~~D~~ ]:  
|  (1) the commissioner shall order the district or  
| campus to develop and implement a targeted improvement plan  
| approved by the board of trustees of the district; and  
|  (2) the interventions and sanctions provided by this  
| _chapter_ [ ~~subchapter~~ ] based on failure to satisfy performance  
| standards under Section 39.054(e) apply to the district or campus  
| only as provided by this section.  
|  (b) The interventions and sanctions provided by this  
| _chapter_ [ ~~subchapter~~ ] based on failure to satisfy performance  
| standards under Section 39.054(e) apply to a district or campus  
| ordered to develop and implement a targeted improvement plan under  
| Subsection (a) only if the district or campus is assigned:  
|  (1) an overall or domain performance rating of  
| _unacceptable performance_ [ ~~F~~ ]; or  
|  (2) an overall performance rating of _performance that_  
| _needs improvement_ [ ~~D~~ ] as provided by Subsection (c).  
|  (c) If a school district or campus is assigned an overall  
| performance rating of _performance that needs improvement_ [ ~~D~~ ] for a  
| school year after the district or campus is ordered to develop and  
| implement a targeted improvement plan under Subsection (a), the  
| commissioner shall implement interventions and sanctions that  
| apply to an unacceptable campus and those interventions and  
| sanctions shall continue for each consecutive school year  
| thereafter in which the campus is assigned an overall performance  
| rating of _performance that needs improvement_ [ ~~D~~ ].  
|  (d) The commissioner shall adopt rules as necessary to  
| implement this section.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 42.005(k), Education Code, is amended to

|  (1) all campuses of the charter school operating  
| before January 1, 2015; and  
|  (2) any campus or site expansion approved on or after  
| January 1, 2015, provided that the charter school received an  
| academic accountability performance rating of _acceptable_  
| _performance_ [ ~~C~~ ] or higher, and the campus or site expansion is  
| approved by the commissioner.  
|  SECTION 5. To the extent of any conflict, this Act prevails  
| over another Act of the 86th Legislature, Regular Session, 2019,

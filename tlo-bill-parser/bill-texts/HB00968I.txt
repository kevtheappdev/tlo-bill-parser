|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the provision of funding under the foundation school  
| program on the basis of property values that do not take into  
| account optional homestead exemptions.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 7.062(c), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if the  
| commissioner certifies that the amount appropriated for a state  
| fiscal year for purposes of Subchapters A and B, Chapter 46, exceeds  
| the amount to which school districts are entitled under those  
| subchapters for that year, the commissioner shall use the excess  
| funds, in an amount not to exceed $20 million in any state fiscal  
| year, for the purpose of making grants under this section. The use  
| of excess funds under this subsection has priority over any  
| provision of Chapter 42 that permits or directs the use of excess  
| foundation school program funds, including Sections 42.2517,  
| 42.2521, [ ~~42.2522,~~ ] and 42.2531. The commissioner is required to

| commissioner is not required to reduce the total amount of state  
| funds allocated to school districts under Section 42.253(h).

| amount of any captured appraised value of property that:  
|  (A) is within a reinvestment zone created on or  
| before May 31, 1999, or is proposed to be included within the  
| boundaries of a reinvestment zone as the boundaries of the zone and  
| the proposed portion of tax increment paid into the tax increment  
| fund by a school district are described in a written notification  
| provided by the municipality or the board of directors of the zone  
| to the governing bodies of the other taxing units in the manner  
| provided by former Section 311.003(e), Tax Code, before May 31,

| by a municipality with a population of less than 18,000; and  
|  (ii) the project plan for which includes  
| the alteration, remodeling, repair, or reconstruction of a

| as if the residence homesteads were appraised at the full value  
| required by law;

| that, if the tax rate adopted by the district is applied to it,  
| produces an amount equal to the difference between the tax that the  
| district would have imposed on the property if the property were  
| fully taxable at market value and the tax that the district is  
| actually authorized to impose on the property, if this subsection  
| does not otherwise require that portion to be deducted; or

| B or C, Chapter 313, Tax Code, before the expiration of the

| 311.011(c)(8), Tax Code, in the reinvestment zone financing plan  
| approved under Section 311.011(d), Tax Code, before September 1,  
| 1999\. The number of years for which the total dollar amount may be  
| deducted under Subsection _(d)(3)_ [ ~~(d)(4)~~ ] shall for any zone,  
| including those created on or before January 1, 1999, be limited to  
| the duration of the zone as specified as required by Section  
| 311.011(c)(9), Tax Code, in the reinvestment zone financing plan  
| approved under Section 311.011(d), Tax Code, before September 1,  
| 1999\. The total dollar amount deducted under Subsection _(d)(3)_  
| [ ~~(d)(4)~~ ] for any zone, including those created on or before January  
| 1, 1999, may not be increased by any reinvestment zone financing  
| plan amendments that occur after August 31, 1999. The total dollar  
| amount deducted under Subsection _(d)(3)_ [ ~~(d)(4)~~ ] for any zone,  
| including those created on or before January 1, 1999, may not be  
| increased by a change made after August 31, 1999, in the portion of  
| the tax increment retained by the school district.  
|  (e-1) This subsection applies only to a reinvestment zone  
| created by a municipality that has a population of 70,000 or less  
| and is located in a county in which all or part of a military  
| installation is located.  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), if on or  
| after January 1, 2017, the municipality adopts an ordinance  
| designating a termination date for the zone that is later than the  
| termination date designated in the ordinance creating the zone, the  
| number of years for which the total dollar amount may be deducted  
| under Subsection _(d)(3)_ [ ~~(d)(4)~~ ] is limited to the duration of the  
| zone as determined under Section 311.017, Tax Code.  
|  (i) If the comptroller determines in the study that the  
| market value of property in a school district as determined by the  
| appraisal district that appraises property for the school district,  
| less the total of the amounts and values listed in Subsection (d) as  
| determined by that appraisal district, is valid, the comptroller,  
| in determining the taxable value of property in the school district  
| under Subsection (d), shall for purposes of Subsection _(d)(12)_  
| [ ~~(d)(13)~~ ] subtract from the market value as determined by the  
| appraisal district of residence homesteads to which Section 23.23,  
| Tax Code, applies the amount by which that amount exceeds the  
| appraised value of those properties as calculated by the appraisal  
| district under Section 23.23, Tax Code.  If the comptroller  
| determines in the study that the market value of property in a  
| school district as determined by the appraisal district that  
| appraises property for the school district, less the total of the  
| amounts and values listed in Subsection (d) as determined by that  
| appraisal district, is not valid, the comptroller, in determining  
| the taxable value of property in the school district under  
| Subsection (d), shall for purposes of Subsection _(d)(12)_ [ ~~(d)(13)~~ ]  
| subtract from the market value as estimated by the comptroller of  
| residence homesteads to which Section 23.23, Tax Code, applies the  
| amount by which that amount exceeds the appraised value of those  
| properties as calculated by the appraisal district under Section  
| 23.23, Tax Code.  
|  (m) Subsection _(d)(8)_ [ ~~(d)(9)~~ ] does not apply to property  
| that was the subject of an application under Subchapter B or C,  
| Chapter 313, Tax Code, made after May 1, 2009, that the comptroller  
| recommended should be disapproved.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 311.011(h), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (h) Unless specifically provided otherwise in the plan, all  
| amounts contained in the project plan or reinvestment zone  
| financing plan, including amounts of expenditures relating to  
| project costs and amounts relating to participation by taxing  
| units, are considered estimates and do not act as a limitation on  
| the described items, but the amounts contained in the project plan  
| or reinvestment zone financing plan may not vary materially from  
| the estimates.  This subsection may not be construed to increase the  
| amount of any reduction under Section _403.302(d)(3)_  
| [ ~~403.302(d)(4)~~ ], Government Code, in the total taxable value of the  
| property in a school district that participates in the zone as  
| computed under Section 403.302(d) of that code.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 311.013(n), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (n) This subsection applies only to a school district whose  
| taxable value computed under Section 403.302(d), Government Code,  
| is reduced in accordance with Subdivision _(3)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] of that  
| subsection.  In addition to the amount otherwise required to be paid  
| into the tax increment fund, the district shall pay into the fund an  
| amount equal to the amount by which the amount of taxes the district  
| would have been required to pay into the fund in the current year if  
| the district levied taxes at the rate the district levied in 2005  
| exceeds the amount the district is otherwise required to pay into  
| the fund in the year of the reduction.  This additional amount may  
| not exceed the amount the school district receives in state aid for  
| the current tax year under Section 42.2514, Education Code.  The  
| school district shall pay the additional amount after the district  
| receives the state aid to which the district is entitled for the  
| current tax year under Section 42.2514, Education Code.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 42.2522, Education Code, is repealed.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 403.302, Government Code, as amended by  
| this Act, applies only to a school district property value study  
| conducted for a tax year that begins on or after January 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

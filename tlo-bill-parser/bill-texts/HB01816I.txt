|  (b) A protest on the ground of unequal appraisal of property  
| shall be determined in favor of the protesting party unless the  
| appraisal district establishes that:

| less than the median level of appraisal of a reasonable and  
| representative sample of other properties in the appraisal  
| district;

| less than the median level of appraisal of a sample of properties in

| properties similarly situated to, or of the same general kind or  
| character as, the property subject to the protest; or  
|  (3) the _appraisal ratio_ [ ~~appraised value~~ ] of the  
| property is equal to or less than the median _level of appraisal_  
| [ ~~appraised value~~ ] of a reasonable number of comparable properties  
| _in the appraisal district_ [ ~~appropriately adjusted~~ ].  
|  _(e) For the purpose of Subsection (b)(3):_  
|  _(1)_ _____a person making a determination that property is_  
| _comparable to another property must base the determination on the_  
| _similarity of the properties with regard to the characteristics_  
| _described by Section 23.013(d); and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a person calculating the median level of appraisal_  
| _of comparable properties must base the calculation on the appraised_  
| _value of each comparable property as shown in the appraisal records_  
| _submitted to the appraisal review board by the chief appraiser_  
| _under Section 25.22 or 25.23._  
|  _(f)_ _____The comptroller shall by rule establish standards for_  
| _the development and calibration of adjustments to the appraised_

|  SECTION 2. Section 42.26, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a) and (b) and adding Subsections (e) and (f) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) The district court shall grant relief on the ground that  
| a property is appraised unequally if:  
|  (1) the appraisal ratio of the property exceeds by at  
| least 10 percent the median level of appraisal of a reasonable and  
| representative sample of other properties in the appraisal  
| district;  
|  (2) the appraisal ratio of the property exceeds by at  
| least 10 percent the median level of appraisal of a sample of  
| properties in the appraisal district consisting of a reasonable  
| number of other properties similarly situated to, or of the same  
| general kind or character as, the property subject to the appeal; or  
|  (3) the _appraisal ratio_ [ ~~appraised value~~ ] of the  
| property exceeds _by at least 10 percent_ the median _level of_  
| _appraisal_ [ ~~appraised value~~ ] of a reasonable number of comparable  
| properties _in the appraisal district_ [ ~~appropriately adjusted~~ ].  
|  (b) If a property owner is entitled to relief under _a_  
| _subdivision of_ Subsection _(a)_ [ ~~(a)(1)~~ ], the court shall order the  
| property's appraised value changed to the value as calculated on  
| the basis of the median level of appraisal according to _that_  
| _subdivision_ [ ~~Subsection (a)(1). If a property owner is entitled to~~  
|  ~~relief under Subsection (a)(2), the court shall order the~~  
|  ~~property's appraised value changed to the value calculated on the~~  
|  ~~basis of the median level of appraisal according to Subsection~~  
|  ~~(a)(2). If a property owner is entitled to relief under Subsection~~  
|  ~~(a)(3), the court shall order the property's appraised value~~  
|  ~~changed to the value calculated on the basis of the median appraised~~  
|  ~~value according to Subsection (a)(3)~~ ]. If a property owner is  
| entitled to relief under more than one subdivision of Subsection  
| (a), the court shall order the property's appraised value changed  
| to the value that results in the lowest appraised value. The court  
| shall determine each applicable median level of appraisal [ ~~or~~  
|  ~~median appraised value~~ ] according to law, and is not required to  
| adopt the median level of appraisal [ ~~or median appraised value~~ ]  
| proposed by a party to the appeal. The court may not limit or deny  
| relief to the property owner entitled to relief under a subdivision  
| of Subsection (a) because the appraised value determined according  
| to another subdivision of Subsection (a) results in a higher  
| appraised value.  
|  _(e) For the purpose of Subsection (a)(3):_  
|  _(1)_ _____a person making a determination that property is_  
| _comparable to another property must base the determination on the_  
| _similarity of the properties with regard to the characteristics_  
| _described by Section 23.013(d); and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a person calculating the median level of appraisal_  
| _of comparable properties must base the calculation on the appraised_  
| _value of each comparable property as shown in the appraisal records_  
| _certified by the chief appraiser under Section 26.01._  
|  _(f)_ _____The comptroller shall by rule establish standards for_  
| _the development and calibration of adjustments to the appraised_  
| _value for industrial, petrochemical refining and processing, and_  
| _utility properties and other unique properties._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 42.29, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsection (b) and adding Subsection (c) to read as follows:  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the amount of an award  
| of attorney's fees _to a property owner_ may not exceed the lesser of:  
|  (1) $100,000; or  
|  (2) the total amount by which the property owner's tax  
| liability is reduced as a result of the appeal.

| _chief appraiser that prevails in an appeal under Section 42.26 may_  
| _be awarded reasonable attorney's fees. The amount of the award may_  
| _not exceed $15,000._  
|  SECTION 4. Not later than January 1, 2020, the comptroller  
| shall establish the standards required by Sections 41.43(f) and

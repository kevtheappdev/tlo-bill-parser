| 5.01 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___5.01._ _____PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION ADVISORY BOARD._  
| _(a)_ _____The comptroller shall appoint the property tax administration_  
| _advisory board to advise the comptroller with respect to the_  
| _division or divisions within the office of the comptroller with_  
| _primary responsibility for state administration of property_  
| _taxation and state oversight of appraisal districts. The advisory_

| _improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the property tax_  
| _system, best practices, and complaint resolution procedures. The_  
| _comptroller shall post the recommendations of the advisory board on_  
| _the comptroller's Internet website._

| _described by Subsection (a) that is provided by a member of the_  
| _advisory board must be provided at a meeting called by the_  
| _comptroller._  
|  _(e)_ _____Chapter 2110, Government Code, does not apply to the_

|  SECTION 2. Section 5.07, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) to read as follows:  
|  _(f)_ _____The comptroller shall prescribe tax rate calculation_  
| _forms to be used by the designated officer or employee of each_  
| _taxing unit to calculate and submit the no-new-revenue tax rate and_  
| _the rollback tax rate for the taxing unit as required by Chapter 26._  
|  _(g)_ _____The forms described by Subsection (f) must be in an_  
| _electronic format and:_  
|  _(1) have blanks that can be filled in electronically;_  
|  _(2)_ _____be capable of being certified by the designated_  
| _officer or employee after completion as accurately calculating the_  
| _applicable tax rates and using values that are the same as the_

| _agreement of a majority of the members of a committee selected by_  
| _the comptroller. The members of the committee must represent,_

| collected in excess of the anticipated amount in the preceding  
| year.  
|  (c) _After the assessor for the taxing unit submits the_  
| _appraisal roll for the taxing unit to the governing body of the_

| dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE = ( _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ]  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT  
| RATE  
|  (d) The _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate for a county is  
| the sum of the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rates calculated for

| of tax the county levies.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The designated officer or employee shall use the tax_  
| _rate calculation forms prescribed by the comptroller under Section_  
| _5.07 in calculating the no-new-revenue tax rate and the rollback_  
| _tax rate._  
|  _(d-2)_ _____The designated officer or employee may not submit the_

| prescribed by the comptroller:  
|  (1) the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate, the  
| rollback tax rate, and an explanation of how they were calculated;  
|  (2) the estimated amount of interest and sinking fund

| _chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall deliver by regular_  
| _mail or e-mail to each owner of property located in the appraisal_  
| _district a notice that the estimated amount of taxes to be imposed_  
| _on the owner's property by each taxing unit in which the property is_

|  (f) If as a result of consolidation of taxing units a taxing  
| unit includes territory that was in two or more taxing units in the  
| preceding year, the amount of taxes imposed in each in the preceding  
| year is combined for purposes of calculating the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] and rollback tax rates under this section.  
|  (g) A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an  
| injunction prohibiting the taxing unit in which the property is  
| taxable from adopting a tax rate if the assessor or designated  
| officer or employee of the _taxing_ unit, _the chief appraiser of the_  
| _applicable appraisal district, or the taxing unit,_ as applicable,  
| has not complied with the computation _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] publication _, or
posting_  
| requirements of this section _or Section 26.17 or 26.18_ [ ~~and the~~  
|  ~~failure to comply was not in good faith~~ ]. _It is a defense in an_  
| _action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to_  
| _comply was in good faith._  
|  (i) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that has agreed  
| by written contract to transfer a distinct department, function, or  
| activity to another taxing unit and discontinues operating that  
| distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of that  
| department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the  
| territory of the taxing unit is continued by another existing  
| taxing unit or by a new taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a  
| taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year  
| in which a budget is adopted that does not allocate revenue to the  
| discontinued department, function, or activity is calculated as  
| otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy  
| used to calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is reduced by the amount of  
| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit to  
| operate the department, function, or activity for the 12 months  
| preceding the month in which the calculations required by this  
| chapter are made and in which the _taxing_ unit operated the  
| discontinued department, function, or activity. If the _taxing_ unit  
| did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full  
| 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by  
| this chapter are made, the _taxing_ unit shall reduce last year's levy  
| used for calculating the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  
| and operations rate of the _taxing_ unit by the amount of the revenue  
| spent in the last full fiscal year in which the _taxing_ unit operated  
| the discontinued department, function, or activity.  
|  (j) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed  
| by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct  
| department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and  
| operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the  
| operation of a substantially similar department, function, or  
| activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit  
| has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved  
| taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a taxing unit to which this  
| subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit  
| discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or  
| activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the  
| department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise  
| provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to  
| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is increased by the amount of  
| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit  
| that discontinued operating the substantially similar department,  
| function, or activity to operate that department, function, or  
| activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the  
| calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the  
| _taxing_ unit operated the discontinued department, function, or  
| activity. If the _taxing_ unit did not operate the discontinued  
| department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding  
| the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are  
| made, the _taxing_ unit may increase last year's levy used to  
| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property  
| tax revenue spent by the discontinuing _taxing_ unit to operate the  
| discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full  
| fiscal year in which the discontinuing _taxing_ unit operated the  
| department, function, or activity.  
|  SECTION 9. Sections 26.041(a), (b), (c), (e), (g), and (h),  
| Tax Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  
| tax is required to be collected, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax  
| rate and rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated  
| according to the following formulas:  
|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S  
| LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW  
| PROPERTY VALUE) _]_ \- SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| and  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE = ( _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ]  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT  
| RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following  
| year as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the  
| current total value.  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional  
| sales and use tax _,_ the rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit is  
| calculated according to the following formula, regardless of  
| whether the _taxing_ unit levied a property tax in the preceding year:  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ] CURRENT _TOTAL_  
| VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE -  
| SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)  
| where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the  
| amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and  
| additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and  
| "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year  
| as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the current  
| total value.  
|  (c) In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing  
| an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales  
| and use tax _,_ the _no-new revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate and rollback  
| tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the  
| following formulas:  
|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW  
| PROPERTY VALUE)] + SALES TAX LOSS RATE  
| and  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ] CURRENT _TOTAL_  
| VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE  
| where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales  
| and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which  
| the information is available by the current total value and "last  
| year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent  
| for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional  
| sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.  
|  (e) If a city that imposes an additional sales and use tax  
| receives payments under the terms of a contract executed before  
| January 1, 1986, in which the city agrees not to annex certain  
| property or a certain area and the owners or lessees of the property  
| or of property in the area agree to pay at least annually to the city  
| an amount determined by reference to all or a percentage of the  
| property tax rate of the city and all or a part of the value of the  
| property subject to the agreement or included in the area subject to  
| the agreement, the governing body, by order adopted by a majority  
| vote of the governing body, may direct the designated officer or  
| employee to add to the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] and rollback tax  
| rates the amount that, when applied to the total taxable value  
| submitted to the governing body, would produce an amount of taxes  
| equal to the difference between the total amount of payments for the  
| tax year under contracts described by this subsection under the  
| rollback tax rate calculated under this section and the total  
| amount of payments for the tax year that would have been obligated  
| to the city if the city had not adopted an additional sales and use  
| tax.  
|  (g) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  
| increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  
| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  
| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  
| account the increase and the second projection must not take into  
| account the increase. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  
| then subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from  
| the amount of the result of the first projection to determine the  
| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  
| sales and use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales  
| and use tax is increased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| for the _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the  
| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  
| sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the  
| denominator of which is the current total value minus the new  
| property value.  
|  (h) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  
| decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  
| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  
| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  
| account the decrease and the second projection must not take into  
| account the decrease. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  
| then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from  
| the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the  
| revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and  
| use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax  
| is decreased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate for the  
| _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate before the  
| decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as  
| a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as  
| determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is  
| the current total value minus the new property value.  
|  SECTION 10. The heading to Section 26.043, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.043. _ROLLBACK AND NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX  
| _RATES_ [ ~~RATE~~ ] IN CITY IMPOSING MASS TRANSIT SALES AND USE TAX.  
|  SECTION 11. Sections 26.043(a) and (b), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the tax year in which a city has set an election on  
| the question of whether to impose a local sales and use tax under  
| Subchapter H, Chapter 453, Transportation Code, the officer or  
| employee designated to make the calculations provided by Section  
| 26.04 may not make those calculations until the outcome of the  
| election is determined. If the election is determined in favor of  
| the imposition of the tax, the _designated officer or employee_  
| [ ~~representative~~ ] shall subtract from the city's rollback and  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rates the amount that, if applied to  
| the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the  
| amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for  
| expenses related to mass transit services.  
|  (b) In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference  
| in this chapter to the city's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] or  
| rollback tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this  
| section.  
|  SECTION 12. The heading to Section 26.044, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.044. _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE TO PAY FOR  
| STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MANDATE.  
|  SECTION 13. Sections 26.044(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The first time that a county adopts a tax rate after  
| September 1, 1991, in which the state criminal justice mandate  
| applies to the county, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  
| and operation rate for the county is increased by the rate  
| calculated according to the following formula:  
|  (State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current Total  
| Value - New Property Value)  
|  (b) In the second and subsequent years that a county adopts  
| a tax rate, if the amount spent by the county for the state criminal  
| justice mandate increased over the previous year, the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate for the  
| county is increased by the rate calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  (This Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate - Previous  
| Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current  
| Total Value - New Property Value)  
|  (c) The county shall include a notice of the increase in the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate provided  
| by this section, including a description and amount of the state  
| criminal justice mandate, in the information published under  
| Section 26.04(e) and Section 26.06(b) [ ~~of this code~~ ].  
|  SECTION 14. Sections 26.0441(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the first tax year in which a taxing unit adopts a tax  
| rate after January 1, 2000, and in which the enhanced minimum  
| eligibility standards for indigent health care established under  
| Section 61.006, Health and Safety Code, apply to the taxing unit,  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate for  
| the taxing unit is increased by the rate computed according to the  
| following formula:  
|  Amount of Increase = Enhanced Indigent Health Care  
| Expenditures / (Current Total Value - New Property  
| Value)  
|  (b) In each subsequent tax year, if the taxing unit's  
| enhanced indigent health care expenses exceed the amount of those  
| expenses for the preceding year, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  
| maintenance and operations rate for the taxing unit is increased by  
| the rate computed according to the following formula:  
|  Amount of Increase = (Current Tax Year's Enhanced  
| Indigent Health Care Expenditures - Preceding Tax  
| Year's Indigent Health Care Expenditures) / (Current  
| Total Value - New Property Value)  
|  (c) The taxing unit shall include a notice of the increase  
| in its _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate  
| provided by this section, including a brief description and the  
| amount of the enhanced indigent health care expenditures, in the  
| information published under Section 26.04(e) and, if applicable,  
| Section 26.06(b).  
|  SECTION 15. Section 26.05, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) and adding Subsections  
| (d-1) and (d-2) to read as follows:  
|  (b) A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year  
| until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and  
| the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order,  
| depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by  
| the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order  
| setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the  
| budget. For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on  
| the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate must be a record vote, and  
| at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote  
| in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order. For a school  
| district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a  
| tax rate that exceeds the sum of the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  
| maintenance and operations tax rate of the district as determined  
| under Section 26.08(i) and the district's current debt rate must be  
| a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the  
| governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or  
| order. A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting  
| a tax rate that exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| must be made in the following form: "I move that the property tax  
| rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax  
| rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the  
| proposed tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate)  
| percent increase in the tax rate." If the ordinance, resolution, or  
| order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value,  
| will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation  
| expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes  
| imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit  
| must:  
|  (1) include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in  
| type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:  
|  (A) the following statement:  "THIS TAX RATE WILL  
| RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S  
| TAX RATE."; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  
| statement:  "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  
| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  
| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  
| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  
| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."; and  
|  (2) include on the home page of any Internet website  
| operated by the _taxing_ unit:  
|  (A) the following statement: "(Insert name of  
| _taxing_ unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  
| statement:  "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  
| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  
| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  
| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  
| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."  
|  (c) If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a  
| tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate  
| for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate calculated for that tax year or  
| the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  
| A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted  
| tax rate. Before the fifth day after the establishment of a tax  
| rate by this subsection, the governing body of the taxing unit must  
| ratify the applicable tax rate in the manner required by Subsection  
| (b).  
|  (d) The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school  
| district may not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the  
| rollback tax rate or the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| calculated as provided by this chapter until the governing body has  
| held two public hearings on the proposed tax rate and has otherwise  
| complied with Section 26.06 and Section 26.065. The governing body  
| of a taxing unit shall reduce a tax rate set by law or by vote of the  
| electorate to the lower of the rollback tax rate or the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate and may not adopt a higher rate  
| unless it first complies with Section 26.06.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit other than a_  
| _school district may not hold a public hearing on a proposed tax rate_  
| _or a public meeting to adopt a tax rate until the seventh day after_  
| _the date the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the_  
| _taxing unit participates has:_  
|  _(1)_ _____delivered the notice required by Section_  
| _26.04(e-2); and_  
|  _(2) complied with Section 26.17(e)._  
|  _(d-2)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of_  
| _a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate_  
| _until the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the_  
| _taxing unit participates has complied with Subsection (d-1)._  
|  (e) A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an  
| injunction restraining the collection of taxes by a taxing unit in  
| which the property is taxable if the taxing unit has not complied  
| with the requirements of this section _or Section 26.04_ [ ~~and the~~  
|  ~~failure to comply was not in good faith~~ ]. _It is a defense in an_  
| _action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to_  
| _comply was in good faith._ An action to enjoin the collection of  
| taxes must be filed _not later than the 15th day after the date the_  
| _taxing unit adopts a tax rate. A property owner is not required to_  
| _pay the taxes imposed by a taxing unit on the owner's property while_  
| _an action filed by the property owner to enjoin the collection of_  
| _taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the owner's property is pending._  
| _If the property owner pays the taxes and subsequently prevails in_  
| _the action, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the taxes_  
| _paid, together with reasonable attorney's fees and court costs._ __  
| _The property owner is not required to apply to the collector for the_  
| _taxing unit to receive the refund_ [ ~~prior to the date a taxing unit~~  
|  ~~delivers substantially all of its tax bills~~ ].  
|  (g) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a  
| school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption  
| of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year  
| may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the  
| certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief  
| appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district  
| participates has certified to the assessor for the school district  
| an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district  
| as provided by Section 26.01(e).  If a school district adopts a tax  
| rate under this subsection, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| and the rollback tax rate of the district shall be calculated based  
| on the certified estimate of taxable value.  
|  SECTION 16. Sections 26.052(c) and (e), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) A taxing unit to which this section applies may provide  
| public notice of its proposed tax rate in _one_ [ ~~either~~ ] of the  
| following methods not later than the seventh day before the date on  
| which the tax rate is adopted:  
|  (1) mailing a notice of the proposed tax rate to each  
| owner of taxable property in the taxing unit; [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (2) publishing notice of the proposed tax rate in the  
| legal notices section of a newspaper having general circulation in  
| the taxing unit _; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____posting notice of the proposed tax rate_  
| _prominently on the home page of the Internet website maintained by_  
| _the taxing unit, if applicable_.  
|  (e) Public notice provided under Subsection (c) must  
| specify:  
|  (1) the tax rate that the governing body proposes to  
| adopt;  
|  (2) the date, time, and location of the meeting of the  
| governing body of the taxing unit at which the governing body will  
| consider adopting the proposed tax rate; and  
|  (3) if the proposed tax rate for the taxing unit  
| exceeds the _taxing_ unit's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| calculated as provided by Section 26.04, a statement substantially  
| identical to the following: "The proposed tax rate would increase  
| total taxes in (name of taxing unit) by (percentage by which the  
| proposed tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax  
| rate)."  
|  SECTION 17. Sections 26.06(b), (c), (d), and (e), Tax Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) The notice of a public hearing may not be smaller than  
| one-quarter page of a standard-size or a tabloid-size newspaper,  
| and the headline on the notice must be in 24-point or larger type.  
| The notice must contain a statement in the following form:  
| "NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING ON TAX INCREASE  
|  "The (name of the taxing unit) will hold two public hearings  
| on a proposal to increase total tax revenues from properties on the  
| tax roll in the preceding tax year by (percentage by which proposed  
| tax rate exceeds lower of rollback tax rate or _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate calculated under this chapter) percent. Your  
| individual taxes may increase at a greater or lesser rate, or even  
| decrease, depending on the _tax rate that is adopted and on the_  
| change in the taxable value of your property in relation to the  
| change in taxable value of all other property [ ~~and the tax rate that~~  
|  ~~is adopted~~ ]. _The change in the taxable value of your property in_  
| _relation to the change in the taxable value of all other property_  
| _determines the distribution of the tax burden among all property_  
| _owners._  
|  "The first public hearing will be held on (date and time) at  
| (meeting place).  
|  "The second public hearing will be held on (date and time) at

|  (c) The notice of a public hearing under this section may be  
| delivered by mail to each property owner in the _taxing_ unit, [ ~~or may~~  
|  ~~be~~ ] published in a newspaper _, or posted prominently on the home
page_  
| _of the Internet website operated by the taxing unit, if applicable_.  
| If the notice is published in a newspaper, it may not be in the part  
| of the paper in which legal notices and classified advertisements  
| appear. If the taxing unit _posts the notice on_ [ ~~operates~~ ] an  
| Internet website _operated by the taxing unit_ , the notice must be  
| posted on the website from the date the notice is first _posted_  
| [ ~~published~~ ] until the second public hearing is concluded.  
|  (d) At the public hearings the governing body shall announce  
| the date, time, and place of the meeting at which it will vote on the  
| proposed tax rate. After each hearing the governing body shall give  
| notice of the meeting at which it will vote on the proposed tax rate  
| and the notice shall be in the same form as prescribed by  
| Subsections (b) and (c), except that it must state the following:  
| "NOTICE OF TAX REVENUE INCREASE  
|  "The (name of the taxing unit) conducted public hearings on  
| (date of first hearing) and (date of second hearing) on a proposal  
| to increase the total tax revenues of the (name of the taxing unit)  
| from properties on the tax roll in the preceding year by (percentage  
| by which proposed tax rate exceeds lower of rollback tax rate or  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate calculated under this chapter)  
| percent.  
|  "The total tax revenue proposed to be raised last year at last  
| year's tax rate of (insert tax rate for the preceding year) for each

|  (e) The meeting to vote on the tax increase may not be  
| earlier than the third day or later than the 14th day after the date  
| of the second public hearing. The meeting must be held inside the  
| boundaries of the taxing unit in a publicly owned building or, if a  
| suitable publicly owned building is not available, in a suitable  
| building to which the public normally has access. If the governing  
| body does not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the  
| rollback tax rate or the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate by the  
| 14th day, it must give a new notice under Subsection (d) before it  
| may adopt a rate that exceeds the lower of the rollback tax rate or  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate.  
|  SECTION 18. Section 26.065(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) If the taxing unit owns, operates, or controls an  
| Internet website, the _taxing_ unit shall post notice of the public  
| hearing _prominently_ on the _home page of the_ website continuously  
| for at least seven days immediately before the public hearing on the  
| proposed tax rate increase and at least seven days immediately  
| before the date of the vote proposing the increase in the tax rate.  
|  SECTION 19. Sections 26.08(g), (i), (n), and (p), Tax Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (g) In a school district that received distributions from an  
| equalization tax imposed under former Chapter 18, Education Code,  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] rate of that tax as of the date of  
| the county unit system's abolition is added to the district's  
| rollback tax rate.  
|  (i) For purposes of this section, the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations tax rate of a school  
| district is the tax rate that, applied to the current total value  
| for the district, would impose taxes in an amount that, when added  
| to state funds that would be distributed to the district under  
| Chapter 42, Education Code, for the school year beginning in the  
| current tax year using that tax rate, would provide the same amount  
| of state funds distributed under Chapter 42, Education Code, and  
| maintenance and operations taxes of the district per student in  
| weighted average daily attendance for that school year that would  
| have been available to the district in the preceding year if the  
| funding elements for Chapters 41 and 42, Education Code, for the  
| current year had been in effect for the preceding year.  
|  (n) For purposes of this section, the rollback tax rate of a  
| school district whose maintenance and operations tax rate for the  
| 2005 tax year was $1.50 or less per $100 of taxable value is:  
|  (1) for the 2006 tax year, the sum of the rate that is  
| equal to 88.67 percent of the maintenance and operations tax rate  
| adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year, the rate of $0.04 per  
| $100 of taxable value, and the district's current debt rate; and  
|  (2) for the 2007 and subsequent tax years, the lesser  
| of the following:  
|  (A) the sum of the following:  
|  (i) the rate per $100 of taxable value that  
| is equal to the product of the state compression percentage, as  
| determined under Section 42.2516, Education Code, for the current  
| year and $1.50;  
|  (ii) the rate of $0.04 per $100 of taxable  
| value;  
|  (iii) the rate that is equal to the sum of  
| the differences for the 2006 and each subsequent tax year between  
| the adopted tax rate of the district for that year if the rate was  
| approved at an election under this section and the rollback tax rate  
| of the district for that year; and  
|  (iv) the district's current debt rate; or  
|  (B) the sum of the following:  
|  (i) the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]

| determined under Section 42.2516, Education Code, for the current  
| year and $0.06; and  
|  (iii) the district's current debt rate.  
|  (p) Notwithstanding Subsections (i), (n), and (o), if for  
| the preceding tax year a school district adopted a maintenance and  
| operations tax rate that was less than the district's  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations tax rate for

| maintenance and operations tax rate for the preceding tax year that  
| was equal to the district's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  
| and operations tax rate for that preceding tax year.  
|  SECTION 20. Section 26.16, Tax Code, is amended by amending

| follows:  
|  (a) The county assessor-collector for each county that  
| maintains an Internet website shall post on the website of the  
| county the following information for the most recent five tax years  
| [ ~~beginning with the 2012 tax year~~ ] for each taxing unit all or part  
| of the territory of which is located in the county:  
|  (1) the adopted tax rate;  
|  (2) the maintenance and operations rate;  
|  (3) the debt rate;  
|  (4) the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate;  
|  (5) the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate; and  
|  (6) the rollback tax rate.  
|  _(a-1)_ _____For purposes of Subsection (a), a reference to the_  
| _no-new-revenue tax rate or the no-new-revenue maintenance and_  
| _operations rate includes the equivalent effective tax rate or_  
| _effective maintenance and operations rate for a preceding year._  
| _This subsection expires January 1, 2026._  
|  (d) The county assessor-collector shall post immediately  
| below the table prescribed by Subsection (c) the following  
| statement:  
|  "The county is providing this table of property tax rate  
| information as a service to the residents of the county. Each  
| individual taxing unit is responsible for calculating the property  
| tax rates listed in this table pertaining to that taxing unit and  
| providing that information to the county.  
|  "The adopted tax rate is the tax rate adopted by the governing  
| body of a taxing unit.  
|  "The maintenance and operations rate is the component of the  
| adopted tax rate of a taxing unit that will impose the amount of  
| taxes needed to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the  
| _taxing_ unit for the following year.  
|  "The debt rate is the component of the adopted tax rate of a  
| taxing unit that will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund the  
| _taxing_ unit's debt service for the following year.  
|  "The _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate is the tax rate that  
| would generate the same amount of revenue in the current tax year as  
| was generated by a taxing unit's adopted tax rate in the preceding  
| tax year from property that is taxable in both the current tax year  
| and the preceding tax year.  
|  "The _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations  
| rate is the tax rate that would generate the same amount of revenue  
| for maintenance and operations in the current tax year as was  
| generated by a taxing unit's maintenance and operations rate in the  
| preceding tax year from property that is taxable in both the current  
| tax year and the preceding tax year.  
|  "The rollback tax rate is the highest tax rate a taxing unit  
| may adopt before requiring voter approval at an election. In the  
| case of a taxing unit other than a school district, the voters by  
| petition may require that a rollback election be held if the _taxing_  
| unit adopts a tax rate in excess of the _taxing_ unit's rollback tax  
| rate. In the case of a school district, an election will  
| automatically be held if the district wishes to adopt a tax rate in  
| excess of the district's rollback tax rate."

| dedicate a specific percentage of the local tax levy to the use of

| maintenance and operating expenses of the junior college district.  
| To be effective, the dedication must be made by the governing body  
| on or before the date on which the governing body adopts its tax  
| rate for a year. The amount of local tax funds derived from the  
| percentage of the local tax levy dedicated to a junior college

| exceed the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value  
| submitted to the governing body under Section 26.04, Tax Code,  
| would impose an amount equal to the amount of taxes of the school  
| district dedicated to the junior college under [ ~~Subsection (e) of~~ ]  
| Section _45.105(e) or former Section 20.48(e)_ [ ~~20.48 of this code~~ ]

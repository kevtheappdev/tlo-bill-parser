| _that, when added to the amount of the mandatory payments required_

| _revenue that exceeds six percent of the aggregate net patient_  
| _revenue of all paying hospitals in the county._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to the maximum amount prescribed by Subsection_  
| _(c), the commissioners court of a county that collects a mandatory_

| _299.103(c)(1), and to pay for indigent programs, except that the_  
| _amount of revenue from mandatory payments used for administrative_  
| _expenses of the county for activities under this chapter in a year_  
| _may not exceed the lesser of four percent of the total revenue_

| _COLLECTION ACTIVITIES; SUIT._ ___(a)_ ___A mandatory payment is_  
| _considered to be delinquent if it is not fully paid within 60 days_  
| _of the due date set by the county. The county may enter into an_  
| _agreement with an institutional health care provider that allows_  
| _payment in installments of a delinquent mandatory payment._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission may contract with any competent attorney_  
| _to represent the county to seek and enforce the collection of_  
| _delinquent mandatory payments. The attorney's compensation is set_  
| _in the contract, but the total amount of compensation provided may_  
| _not exceed the lesser of (1) 20 percent of the amount of delinquent_  
| _mandatory payments collected and (2) $200,000._  
|  _(c)_ _____At any time after a mandatory payment becomes_  
| _delinquent, the county may file suit in a court of competent_  
| _jurisdiction to enforce liability for and collect the mandatory_  
| _payment. The county may recover attorney's fees in a suit to enforce_  
| _liability for and collect a delinquent mandatory payment. Any_  
| _amounts recovered or otherwise received as a result of a suit to_  
| _enforce liability for and collect a delinquent mandatory payment_  
| _shall be deposited into the local provider participation fund._  
|  _Sec._ ___299.154._ _____PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE._ ___(a)_ ___The purpose of this chapter is to generate revenue_  
| _by collecting from institutional health care providers a mandatory_  
| _payment to be used to provide the nonfederal share of a Medicaid_  
| _supplemental payment program._  
|  _(b)_ _____To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the county may provide by_  
| _rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the_  
| _requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

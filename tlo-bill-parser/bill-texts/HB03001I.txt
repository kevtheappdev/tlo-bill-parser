| special purpose district to provide that information and updates to  
| the information as necessary for inclusion in the database _in the_  
| _form and manner prescribed by the comptroller. If the required_  
| _information is posted separately on an Internet website that the_  
| _state agency, comptroller, or special purpose district maintains or_  
| _causes to be maintained, the comptroller may include in the_  
| _database a direct link to, or a clear statement describing the_  
| _location of, the separately posted information instead of or in_  
| _addition to reproducing the information in the database_.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 140.008, Local Government Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (g) and (h) and adding Subsection  
| (i) to read as follows:  
|  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a  
| district, as defined by Section 49.001, Water Code, _that is not a_  
| _district described by Section 403.0241(b), Government Code,_  
| satisfies the requirements of this section if _, on an annual basis,_  
| the district:  
|  (1) complies with the requirements of Subchapter G,  
| Chapter 49, Water Code, regarding audit reports, affidavits of  
| financial dormancy, and annual financial reports; and  
|  (2) _either:_  
|  _(A)_ submits the financial documents described by  
| Subchapter G, Chapter 49, Water Code, to the comptroller _in the form_  
| _and manner prescribed by the comptroller; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____takes action to ensure that the financial_  
| _documents described by Subchapter G, Chapter 49, Water Code, are_  
| _made available at a regular office of the district for inspection by_  
| _any person and are posted continuously for public viewing on the_  
| _district's Internet website_.  
|  (h) The comptroller shall post the documents submitted to  
| the comptroller under Subsection (g) on the comptroller's Internet  
| website _, to the extent that the documents as submitted to the_  
| _comptroller are in a form that facilitates compliance with_  
| _applicable technical accessibility standards and specifications_  
| _established in the electronic and information resources_  
| _accessibility policy adopted by the comptroller under other law._  
| _If the comptroller determines that compliance with posting_  
| _requirements under this section imposes a significant difficulty or_  
| _expense on the district, the comptroller may provide individuals_  
| _with disabilities an alternate method of access as described by_  
| _Section 2054.460, Government Code, instead of posting the documents_  
| _on the comptroller's Internet website_. The comptroller shall adopt  
| rules necessary to implement this subsection and Subsection (g).  
|  _(i)_ _____If information required to be posted by the comptroller_  
| _under this section is posted separately on an Internet website that_  
| _a state agency, the comptroller, or a political subdivision,_  
| _including a district as defined by Section 49.001, Water Code,_  
| _maintains or causes to be maintained, the comptroller may post on_  
| _the comptroller's Internet website a direct link to, or a clear_  
| _statement describing the location of, the separately posted_  
| _information instead of or in addition to reproducing the required_  
| _information on the comptroller's website, if that information is_  
| _easily located by searching the name of the political subdivision_  
| _or district on the Internet._  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a report required to be made on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A report required to be made before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law as it existed immediately before the  
| effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

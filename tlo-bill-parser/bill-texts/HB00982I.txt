|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the administration of "pay for success" contracts for  
| state agencies.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 403.110(c), (e), and (f), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) The trust fund consists of money _gifted, granted,_  
| _donated, or_ appropriated for deposit to the credit of the trust fund  
| and any interest or other earnings attributable to the trust fund.  
| The comptroller shall hold money credited to the trust fund for use  
| only for payments due in accordance with success contract terms and  
| expenses incurred in administering the trust fund or in  
| administering the success contracts for which the trust fund is  
| established. The balance of the trust fund may not exceed $50  
| million at any time. The comptroller may establish in the trust fund  
| one or more accounts to administer money for a particular success  
| contract for which money has been credited to the trust fund.  
|  (e) _A contract executed under this section is not_  
| _enforceable until_ [ ~~The comptroller and a state agency may not~~  
|  ~~finally execute a proposed success contract under this section~~  
|  ~~unless~~ ]:  
|  (1) the state agency and the Legislative Budget Board  
| certify that the proposed contract is expected to result in  
| significant performance improvements and significant budgetary  
| savings for the state agency or agencies party to the contract if  
| the performance targets are achieved; and  
|  (2) _a grantor or donor has gifted, granted, or_  
| _donated, or_ the legislature has appropriated for deposit to the  
| credit of the trust fund, contingent on the execution of the  
| contract, an amount of money necessary to administer the contract  
| and make all payments that may become due under the contract over  
| the effective period of the contract.  
|  (f) The comptroller shall make the contract payments for the  
| success contracts only from the trust fund and only in accordance  
| with the terms of the success contracts. The comptroller shall  
| deposit to the credit of the trust fund any money the comptroller  
| recovers from a contractor for overpayment or for a penalty or other  
| amount recoverable under the terms of a success contract and shall  
| hold the money in the trust fund in the same manner as the money held  
| for payments for the success contract. To the extent that any money  
| credited to the trust fund for a particular success contract  
| remains unpaid at the time the particular contract expires or is  
| terminated, as soon after the contract expiration as is  
| practicable, the comptroller shall return the unpaid amount to the  
| _grantor, donor, or_ state treasury fund or account from which the  
| money was _gifted, granted, donated, or_ appropriated.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

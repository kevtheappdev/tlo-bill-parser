|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to prohibiting the enforcement of certain federal laws;  
| creating a criminal offense.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The Legislature of the State of Texas finds that:  
|  (1) The Tenth Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution reserves to the states and the people all powers not  
| granted to the federal government elsewhere in the constitution, as  
| those powers were understood at the time Texas was admitted to  
| statehood in 1845.  The guaranty of those powers is a matter of  
| contract between the state and people of Texas and the United States  
| dating from the time Texas became a state.  
|  (2) The Ninth Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution guarantees to the people rights not enumerated in the  
| constitution, as those rights were understood at the time Texas  
| became a state.  The guaranty of those rights is a matter of  
| contract between the state and people of Texas and the United States  
| dating from the time Texas became a state.  
|  (3) The Second Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution guarantees the right of the people to keep and bear  
| arms, as that right was understood at the time Texas became a state.  
| The guaranty of that right is a matter of contract between the state  
| and people of Texas and the United States dating from the time Texas  
| became a state.  
|  (4) The First Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution guarantees to the people rights concerning religion,  
| expression, assembly, and petition, as those rights were understood  
| at the time Texas became a state. The guaranty of those rights is a  
| matter of contract between the state and people of Texas and the  
| United States dating from the time Texas became a state.  
|  (5) Section 23, Article I, Texas Constitution, secures  
| to Texas citizens the right to keep and bear arms.  That  
| constitutional protection is unchanged from the date the  
| constitution was adopted in 1876.  
|  SECTION 2. Title 9, Penal Code, is amended by adding Chapter

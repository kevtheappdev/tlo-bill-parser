| discontinued department, function, or activity. If the _taxing_ unit  
| did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full  
| 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by  
| this chapter are made, the _taxing_ unit shall reduce last year's levy  
| used for calculating the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  
| and operations rate of the _taxing_ unit by the amount of the revenue  
| spent in the last full fiscal year in which the _taxing_ unit operated  
| the discontinued department, function, or activity.  
|  (j) This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed  
| by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct  
| department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and  
| operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the  
| operation of a substantially similar department, function, or  
| activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit  
| has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved  
| taxing unit. The rollback tax rate of a taxing unit to which this  
| subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit  
| discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or  
| activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the  
| department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise  
| provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to  
| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate of the _taxing_ unit is increased by the amount of  
| maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit  
| that discontinued operating the substantially similar department,  
| function, or activity to operate that department, function, or  
| activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the  
| calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the  
| _taxing_ unit operated the discontinued department, function, or  
| activity. If the _taxing_ unit did not operate the discontinued  
| department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding  
| the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are  
| made, the _taxing_ unit may increase last year's levy used to  
| calculate the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property  
| tax revenue spent by the discontinuing _taxing_ unit to operate the  
| discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full  
| fiscal year in which the discontinuing _taxing_ unit operated the  
| department, function, or activity.  
|  SECTION 30. Section 26.041, Tax Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (g), and (h) and adding  
| Subsection (c-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  
| tax is required to be collected, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax  
| rate and rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated  
| according to the following formulas:  
|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S  
| LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW  
| PROPERTY VALUE) _]_ \- SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| and  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ =  
| ( _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX  
| GAIN RATE  
| _or_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND_  
| _OPERATIONS RATE x 1.025) + CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES_  
| _TAX GAIN RATE_  
| where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following  
| year as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the  
| current total value.  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional  
| sales and use tax _,_ the rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit is  
| calculated according to the following _applicable_ formula,  
| regardless of whether the _taxing_ unit levied a property tax in the  
| preceding year:  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ]  
| CURRENT _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT  
| DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)  
| _or_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS_  
| _EXPENSE x 1.025) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY_  
| _VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)_  
| where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the  
| amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and  
| additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and  
| "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year  
| as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the current  
| total value.  
|  (c) In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing  
| an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales  
| and use tax _,_ the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate and rollback  
| tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the  
| following formulas:  
|  _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW  
| PROPERTY VALUE)] + SALES TAX LOSS RATE  
| [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ]  
| CURRENT _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT  
| DEBT RATE  
| _and_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS_  
| _EXPENSE x 1.025) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY_  
| _VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE_  
| where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales  
| and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which  
| the information is available by the current total value and "last  
| year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent  
| for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional  
| sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.  
|  _(c-1)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,_  
| _the governing body of a taxing unit other than a small taxing unit_  
| _may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the_  
| _rollback tax rate of the taxing unit in the manner provided for a_  
| _small taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is located in an_  
| _area declared a disaster area during the current tax year by the_  
| _governor or by the president of the United States._ ___The designated_  
| _officer or employee shall continue calculating the rollback tax_  
| _rate in the manner provided by this subsection until the earlier of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the first tax year in which the total taxable value_  
| _of property taxable by the taxing unit as shown on the appraisal_  
| _roll for the taxing unit submitted by the assessor for the taxing_  
| _unit to the governing body exceeds the total taxable value of_  
| _property taxable by the taxing unit on January 1 of the tax year in_  
| _which the disaster occurred; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the fifth tax year after the tax year in which the_  
| _disaster occurred._  
|  (e) If a city that imposes an additional sales and use tax  
| receives payments under the terms of a contract executed before  
| January 1, 1986, in which the city agrees not to annex certain  
| property or a certain area and the owners or lessees of the property  
| or of property in the area agree to pay at least annually to the city  
| an amount determined by reference to all or a percentage of the  
| property tax rate of the city and all or a part of the value of the  
| property subject to the agreement or included in the area subject to  
| the agreement, the governing body, by order adopted by a majority  
| vote of the governing body, may direct the designated officer or  
| employee to add to the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] and rollback tax  
| rates the amount that, when applied to the total taxable value  
| submitted to the governing body, would produce an amount of taxes  
| equal to the difference between the total amount of payments for the  
| tax year under contracts described by this subsection under the  
| rollback tax rate calculated under this section and the total  
| amount of payments for the tax year that would have been obligated  
| to the city if the city had not adopted an additional sales and use  
| tax.  
|  (g) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  
| increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  
| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  
| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  
| account the increase and the second projection must not take into  
| account the increase. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  
| then subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from  
| the amount of the result of the first projection to determine the  
| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  
| sales and use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales  
| and use tax is increased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| for the _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the  
| revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional  
| sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the  
| denominator of which is the current total value minus the new  
| property value.  
|  (h) If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is  
| decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two  
| projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use  
| tax in the following year. The first projection must take into  
| account the decrease and the second projection must not take into  
| account the decrease. The _designated_ officer or employee shall  
| then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from  
| the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the  
| revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and  
| use tax. In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax  
| is decreased, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate for the  
| _taxing_ unit is the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate before the  
| decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as  
| a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as  
| determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is  
| the current total value minus the new property value.  
|  SECTION 31. The heading to Section 26.043, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.043. _ROLLBACK AND NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX  
| _RATES_ [ ~~RATE~~ ] IN CITY IMPOSING MASS TRANSIT SALES AND USE TAX.  
|  SECTION 32. Sections 26.043(a) and (b), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the tax year in which a city has set an election on  
| the question of whether to impose a local sales and use tax under  
| Subchapter H, Chapter 453, Transportation Code, the officer or  
| employee designated to make the calculations provided by Section  
| 26.04 may not make those calculations until the outcome of the  
| election is determined. If the election is determined in favor of  
| the imposition of the tax, the _designated officer or employee_  
| [ ~~representative~~ ] shall subtract from the city's rollback and  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rates the amount that, if applied to  
| the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the  
| amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for  
| expenses related to mass transit services.  
|  (b) In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference  
| in this chapter to the city's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] or  
| rollback tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this  
| section.  
|  SECTION 33. The heading to Section 26.044, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.044. _NO-NEW-REVENUE_ [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] TAX RATE TO PAY FOR  
| STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MANDATE.  
|  SECTION 34. Sections 26.044(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The first time that a county adopts a tax rate after  
| September 1, 1991, in which the state criminal justice mandate  
| applies to the county, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance  
| and operation rate for the county is increased by the rate  
| calculated according to the following formula:  
|  (State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current Total  
| Value - New Property Value)  
|  (b) In the second and subsequent years that a county adopts  
| a tax rate, if the amount spent by the county for the state criminal  
| justice mandate increased over the previous year, the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate for the  
| county is increased by the rate calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  (This Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate - Previous  
| Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current  
| Total Value - New Property Value)  
|  (c) The county shall include a notice of the increase in the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operation rate provided  
| by this section, including a description and amount of the state  
| criminal justice mandate, in the information published under  
| Section 26.04(e) and Section 26.06(b) [ ~~of this code~~ ].  
|  SECTION 35. Sections 26.0441(a), (b), and (c), Tax Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the first tax year in which a taxing unit adopts a tax  
| rate after January 1, 2000, and in which the enhanced minimum  
| eligibility standards for indigent health care established under  
| Section 61.006, Health and Safety Code, apply to the taxing unit,  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate for  
| the taxing unit is increased by the rate computed according to the  
| following formula:  
|  Amount of Increase = Enhanced Indigent Health Care  
| Expenditures / (Current Total Value - New Property  
| Value)  
|  (b) In each subsequent tax year, if the taxing unit's  
| enhanced indigent health care expenses exceed the amount of those  
| expenses for the preceding year, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  
| maintenance and operations rate for the taxing unit is increased by  
| the rate computed according to the following formula:  
|  Amount of Increase = (Current Tax Year's Enhanced  
| Indigent Health Care Expenditures - Preceding Tax  
| Year's Indigent Health Care Expenditures) / (Current  
| Total Value - New Property Value)  
|  (c) The taxing unit shall include a notice of the increase  
| in its _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate  
| provided by this section, including a brief description and the  
| amount of the enhanced indigent health care expenditures, in the  
| information published under Section 26.04(e) and, if applicable,  
| Section 26.06(b).  
|  SECTION 36. Section 26.05, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) and adding Subsections  
| (d-1), (d-2), and (e-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) The governing body of each taxing unit[ ~~, before the~~  
|  ~~later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified~~  
|  ~~appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,~~ ] shall adopt a tax  
| rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the  
| _taxing_ unit of the rate adopted.  _The governing body must adopt a_  
| _tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the_  
| _date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit,_  
| _except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds_  
| _the rollback tax rate before August 15._ The tax rate consists of  
| two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The  
| components are:  
|  (1) for a taxing unit other than a school district, the  
| rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the  
| total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C), less any  
| amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to  
| pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated  
| under Section 44.004(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and  
|  (2) the rate that, if applied to the total taxable  
| value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance  
| and operation expenditures of the _taxing_ unit for the next year.  
|  (b) A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year  
| until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and  
| the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order,  
| depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by  
| the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order  
| setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the  
| budget. For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on  
| the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds  
| the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate must be a record vote, and  
| at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote  
| in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order. For a school  
| district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a  
| tax rate that exceeds the sum of the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  
| maintenance and operations tax rate of the district as determined  
| under Section 26.08(i) and the district's current debt rate must be  
| a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the  
| governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or  
| order. A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting  
| a tax rate that exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| must be made in the following form: "I move that the property tax  
| rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax  
| rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the  
| proposed tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate)  
| percent increase in the tax rate." If the ordinance, resolution, or  
| order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value,  
| will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation  
| expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes  
| imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit  
| must:  
|  (1) include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in  
| type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:  
|  (A) the following statement:  "THIS TAX RATE WILL  
| RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S  
| TAX RATE."; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  
| statement:  "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  
| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  
| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  
| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  
| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."; and  
|  (2) include on the home page of _the_ [ ~~any~~ ] Internet  
| website _of_ [ ~~operated by~~ ] the _taxing_ unit:  
|  (A) the following statement:  "(Insert name of  
| _taxing_ unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and  
|  (B) if the tax rate exceeds the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations rate, the following  
| statement:  "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT  
| PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE _NO-NEW-REVENUE_  
| [ ~~EFFECTIVE~~ ] MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE  
| TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY  
| APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."  
|  (c) If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a  
| tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate  
| for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate calculated for that tax year or  
| the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  
| A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted  
| tax rate. Before the fifth day after the establishment of a tax  
| rate by this subsection, the governing body of the taxing unit must  
| ratify the applicable tax rate in the manner required by Subsection  
| (b).  
|  (d) The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school  
| district may not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the  
| rollback tax rate or the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| calculated as provided by this chapter until the governing body has  
| held two public hearings on the proposed tax rate and has otherwise  
| complied with Section 26.06 and Section 26.065.  The governing body  
| of a taxing unit shall reduce a tax rate set by law or by vote of the  
| electorate to the lower of the rollback tax rate or the  
| _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate and may not adopt a higher rate  
| unless it first complies with Section 26.06.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit may not hold a_  
| _public hearing on a proposed tax rate or a public meeting to adopt a_  
| _tax rate until the 14th day after the date the officer or employee_  
| _designated by the governing body of the taxing unit to calculate the_  
| _no-new-revenue tax rate and the rollback tax rate for the taxing_  
| _unit complies with Section 26.17._  
|  _(d-2)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of_  
| _a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate_  
| _until:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the tax notice officer of each appraisal district_  
| _in which the taxing unit participates has delivered the notice_  
| _required by Section 26.04(e-2);_  
|  _(2)_ _____the designated officer or employee of the taxing_  
| _unit has:_  
|  _(A)_ _____entered in the real-time tax database_  
| _maintained by the tax notice officer the information described by_  
| _Section 26.17(b) for the current tax year; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____incorporated the completed tax rate_  
| _calculation forms prepared under Section 26.04(d-1) into the_  
| _real-time tax database maintained by the tax notice officer; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the taxing unit has posted the information_  
| _described by Section 26.18 on the Internet website used by the_  
| _taxing unit for that purpose._  
|  (e) A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an  
| injunction restraining the collection of taxes by a taxing unit in  
| which the property is taxable if the taxing unit has not complied  
| with the requirements of this section _or Section 26.04_ [ ~~and the~~  
|  ~~failure to comply was not in good faith~~ ]. _It is a defense in an_  
| _action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to_  
| _comply was in good faith._ An action to enjoin the collection of  
| taxes must be filed _not later than the 15th day after the date the_  
| _taxing unit adopts a tax rate. A property owner is not required to_  
| _pay the taxes imposed by a taxing unit on the owner's property while_  
| _an action filed by the property owner to enjoin the collection of_  
| _taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the owner's property is pending._  
| _If the property owner pays the taxes and subsequently prevails in_  
| _the action, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the taxes_  
| _paid, together with reasonable attorney's fees and court costs._ __  
| _The property owner is not required to apply to the collector for the_  
| _taxing unit to receive the refund_ [ ~~prior to the date a taxing unit~~  
|  ~~delivers substantially all of its tax bills~~ ].  
|  _(e-1)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit that imposes an_  
| _additional sales and use tax may not adopt the component of the tax_  
| _rate of the taxing unit described by Subsection (a)(1) of this_  
| _section until the chief financial officer or the auditor for the_  
| _taxing unit submits to the governing body of the taxing unit a_  
| _written certification that the amount of additional sales and use_  
| _tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service has been deducted_  
| _from the total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C) as_  
| _required by Subsection (a)(1) of this section. The comptroller_  
| _shall adopt rules governing the form of the certification required_  
| _by this subsection and the manner in which it is required to be_  
| _submitted._  
|  (g) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a  
| school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption  
| of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year  
| may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the  
| certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief  
| appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district  
| participates has certified to the assessor for the school district  
| an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district  
| as provided by Section 26.01(e).  If a school district adopts a tax  
| rate under this subsection, the _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| and the rollback tax rate of the district shall be calculated based  
| on the certified estimate of taxable value.  
|  SECTION 37. Section 26.052, Tax Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (e) and adding Subsection (f) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (e) Public notice provided under Subsection (c) must  
| specify:  
|  (1) the tax rate that the governing body proposes to  
| adopt;  
|  (2) the date, time, and location of the meeting of the  
| governing body of the taxing unit at which the governing body will  
| consider adopting the proposed tax rate; and  
|  (3) if the proposed tax rate for the taxing unit  
| exceeds the _taxing_ unit's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] tax rate  
| calculated as provided by Section 26.04, a statement substantially

|  _(b-1)_ _____This subsection applies only to a school district._ __  
| _The governing body of a school district shall order that the_  
| _election be held in the school district on the uniform election date_  
| _prescribed by Section 41.001, Election Code, that occurs in_

| _may not be issued later than August 15._ ___At the election, the_  
| _ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or against the_  
| _proposition: "Approving the ad valorem tax rate of $___ per $100_  
| _valuation in (name of school district) for the current year, a rate_  
| _that is $_____ higher per $100 valuation than the rollback tax rate_  
| _of (name of school district), for the purpose of (description of_

| _collect an amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue that is_  
| _at least 2.5 percent greater than the amount of that revenue that_  
| _was collected by the school district in the preceding year."_ ___The_  
| _ballot proposition must include the adopted tax rate and the_  
| _difference between that rate and the rollback tax rate in the_

|  (d) If the proposition is not approved as provided by  
| Subsection (c), the governing body may not adopt a tax rate for the  
| _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] for the current year that exceeds the  
| _taxing unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] rollback tax rate.  
|  (d-1) If, after tax bills for the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school~~  
|  ~~district~~ ] have been mailed, a proposition to approve the _taxing_  
| _unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] adopted tax rate is not approved by the  
| voters of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ] at an election held under this

unit_  
| [ ~~school~~ ] shall prepare and mail corrected tax bills.  The assessor  
| shall include with each bill a brief explanation of the reason for  
| and effect of the corrected bill.  The date on which the taxes  
| become delinquent for the year is extended by a number of days equal  
| to the number of days between the date the first tax bills were sent  
| and the date the corrected tax bills were sent.

| taxpayer forfeits the right to the refund.  
|  (e) For purposes of this section, local tax funds dedicated  
| to a junior college district under Section 45.105(e), Education  
| Code, shall be eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate  
| adopted by the governing body of _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] school district. However,  
| the funds dedicated to the junior college district are subject to  
| Section 26.085.  
|  (g) In a school district that received distributions from an  
| equalization tax imposed under former Chapter 18, Education Code,  
| the _no-new-revenue tax_ [ ~~effective~~ ] rate of that tax as of the date  
| of the county unit system's abolition is added to the district's  
| rollback tax rate.  
|  (h) For purposes of this section, increases in taxable  
| values and tax levies occurring within a reinvestment zone  
| _designated_ under Chapter 311 [ ~~(Tax Increment Financing Act),~~ ] in  
| which _a school_ [ ~~the~~ ] district is a participant[ ~~,~~ ] shall be

| governing body of the school district.  
|  (i) For purposes of this section, the _no-new-revenue_  
| [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations tax rate of a school  
| district is the tax rate that, applied to the current total value  
| for the district, would impose taxes in an amount that, when added  
| to state funds that would be distributed to the district under  
| Chapter 42, Education Code, for the school year beginning in the  
| current tax year using that tax rate, would provide the same amount  
| of state funds distributed under Chapter 42, Education Code, and  
| maintenance and operations taxes of the district per student in  
| weighted average daily attendance for that school year that would  
| have been available to the district in the preceding year if the  
| funding elements for Chapters 41 and 42, Education Code, for the  
| current year had been in effect for the preceding year.  
|  (n) For purposes of this section, the rollback tax rate of a  
| school district [ ~~whose maintenance and operations tax rate for the~~  
|  ~~2005 tax year was $1.50 or less per $100 of taxable value~~ ] is _the
sum_  
| _of the following_ :  
|  (1) _the rate per $100 of taxable value that is equal to_  
| _the product of the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations tax_  
| _rate of the district as computed under Subsection (i) and 1.025_ [ ~~for~~  
|  ~~the 2006 tax year, the sum of the rate that is equal to 88.67 percent~~  
|  ~~of the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district~~  
|  ~~for the 2005 tax year, the rate of $0.04 per $100 of taxable value,~~  
|  ~~and the district's current debt rate~~ ]; and  
|  (2) [ ~~for the 2007 and subsequent tax years, the lesser~~  
|  ~~of the following:~~  
|  [ ~~(A) the sum of the following:~~  
|  [ ~~(i)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the rate per $100 of taxable value that~~  
|  ~~is equal to the product of the state compression percentage, as~~  
|  ~~determined under Section 42.2516, Education Code, for the current~~  
|  ~~year and $1.50;~~  
|  [ ~~(ii)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the rate of $0.04 per $100 of taxable~~  
|  ~~value;~~  
|  [ ~~(iii)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the rate that is equal to the sum of~~  
|  ~~the differences for the 2006 and each subsequent tax year between~~  
|  ~~the adopted tax rate of the district for that year if the rate was~~  
|  ~~approved at an election under this section and the rollback tax rate~~  
|  ~~of the district for that year; and~~  
|  [ ~~(iv) the district's current debt rate; or~~  
|  [ ~~(B) the sum of the following:~~  
|  [ ~~(i)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the effective maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations tax rate of the district as computed under Subsection~~  
|  ~~(i) or (k), as applicable;~~  
|  [ ~~(ii)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the rate per $100 of taxable value~~  
|  ~~that is equal to the product of the state compression percentage, as~~  
|  ~~determined under Section 42.2516, Education Code, for the current~~  
|  ~~year and $0.06; and~~  
|  [ ~~(iii)~~ ] the district's current debt rate.  
|  (p) Notwithstanding Subsections (i) _and_ [ ~~,~~ ] (n), [ ~~and (o),~~ ]  
| if for the preceding tax year a school district adopted a  
| maintenance and operations tax rate that was less than the  
| district's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ] maintenance and operations  
| tax rate for that preceding tax year, the rollback tax rate of the  
| district for the current tax year is calculated as if the district  
| adopted a maintenance and operations tax rate for the preceding tax  
| year that was equal to the district's _no-new-revenue_ [ ~~effective~~ ]  
| maintenance and operations tax rate for that preceding tax year.  
|  _(q)_ _____Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, this_  
| _section does not apply to a tax imposed by a taxing unit if a_  
| _provision of an uncodified local or special law enacted by the 86th_  
| _Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, or by an earlier legislature_  
| _provides that former Section 26.07 does not apply to a tax imposed_  
| _by the taxing unit._

|  ~~of this subchapter.~~ ]  
|  _(d-1)_ _____An appraisal review board to which Section 6.425_  
| _applies shall sit in special panels established under that section_  
| _to conduct protest hearings. A special panel may conduct a protest_

| Subsections (h), (i), (j), and (k) and adding Subsections (j-1),  
| (k-1), and (p) to read as follows:  
|  (h) The appraisal review board shall postpone a hearing on a  
| protest if the property owner _or the designated agent of the owner_  
| requests additional time to prepare for the hearing and establishes  
| to the board that the chief appraiser failed to comply with Section  
| 41.461. The board is not required to postpone a hearing more than  
| one time under this subsection.  
|  (i) A hearing on a protest filed by a property owner _or the_  
| _designated agent of the owner_ [ ~~who is not represented by an agent~~  
|  ~~designated under Section 1.111~~ ] shall be set for a time and date  
| certain.  If the hearing is not commenced within two hours of the  
| time set for the hearing, the appraisal review board shall postpone

| _agent of the owner_.  
|  (j) On the request of a property owner or _the_ [ ~~a~~ ] designated  
| agent _of the owner_ , an appraisal review board shall schedule  
| hearings on protests concerning up to 20 designated properties _to_  
| _be held consecutively_ on the same day.  The designated properties  
| must be identified in the same notice of protest, and the notice  
| must contain in boldfaced type the statement "request for same-day  
| protest hearings."  A property owner or _the_ designated agent _of the_  
| _owner_ may [ ~~not~~ ] file more than one request under this subsection

| in the scheduling of hearings under this subsection.  
|  _(j-1)_ _____An appraisal review board may schedule the hearings on_  
| _all protests filed by a property owner or the designated agent of_  
| _the owner to be held consecutively. The notice of the hearings must_  
| _state the date and time that the first hearing will begin, state the_  
| _date the last hearing will end, and list the order in which the_  
| _hearings will be held. The order of the hearings listed in the_  
| _notice may not be changed without the agreement of the property_  
| _owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and_  
| _the appraisal review board. The board may not reschedule a hearing_  
| _for which notice is given under this subsection to a date earlier_  
| _than the seventh day after the date the last hearing was scheduled_  
| _to end unless agreed to by the property owner or the designated_  
| _agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review_  
| _board. Unless agreed to by the parties, the board must provide_  
| _written notice of the date and time of the rescheduled hearing to_  
| _the property owner or the designated agent of the owner not later_  
| _than the seventh day before the date of the hearing._  
|  (k) _This subsection does not apply to a special panel_  
| _established under Section 6.425._ If an appraisal review board sits  
| in panels to conduct protest hearings, protests shall be randomly  
| assigned to panels, except that the board may consider the type of  
| property subject to the protest or the ground of the protest for the  
| purpose of using the expertise of a particular panel in hearing  
| protests regarding particular types of property or based on  
| particular grounds. If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a  
| particular panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another  
| panel without the consent of the property owner or _the_ designated  
| agent _of the owner_. If the appraisal review board has cause to  
| reassign a protest to another panel, a property owner or _the_  
| designated agent _of the owner_ may agree to reassignment of the  
| protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  
| The board shall postpone the hearing on that request. A change of  
| members of a panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or  
| inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder  
| of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another  
| panel.  
|  _(k-1)_ _____On the request of a property owner or the designated_  
| _agent of the owner, an appraisal review board to which Section 6.425_  
| _applies shall assign a protest relating to property described by_  
| _Section 6.425(b) to a special panel. In addition, the chairman of_  
| _the appraisal review board may assign a protest relating to_  
| _property not described by Section 6.425(b) to a special panel as_  
| _authorized by Section 6.425(f). Protests assigned to special_  
| _panels shall be randomly assigned to those panels. If a protest is_  
| _scheduled to be heard by a particular special panel, the protest may_  
| _not be reassigned to another special panel without the consent of_  
| _the property owner or the designated agent of the owner. If the_  
| _board has cause to reassign a protest to another special panel, a_  
| _property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to_  
| _reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the_  
| _protest be postponed. The board shall postpone the hearing on that_  
| _request. A change of members of a special panel because of a_  
| _conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue_  
| _participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not_  
| _constitute reassignment of a protest to another special panel._  
|  _(p)_ _____At the end of a hearing on a protest, the appraisal_  
| _review board shall provide the property owner or the designated_  
| _agent of the owner one or more documents indicating that the members_

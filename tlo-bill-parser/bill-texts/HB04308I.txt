|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 158, Local Government Code, is amended

| _EMPLOYMENT MATTERS_  
|  _Sec._ ___158.071._ _____APPLICABILITY._ ___This subchapter applies only_  
| _to a county with a population of 3.3 million or more and in which_  
| _Chapter 174 has not been adopted._  
|  _Sec. 158.072. DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Association" means an organization in which_  
| _employees of a sheriff's or constable's department participate and_  
| _that exists, wholly or partly, to deal with a public employer_  
| _regarding grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of_  
| _work, or working conditions affecting the employees._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Public employer" means a sheriff's or constable's_  
| _department, a county, or an agency, board, commission, or political_  
| _subdivision controlled by a county that is required to establish_  
| _wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours of work, working conditions,_  
| _and other terms of employment._  
|  _Sec._ ___158.073._ _____GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO AGREEMENTS,_  
| _RECOGNITION, AND STRIKES._ ___(a) A county may not be denied local_  
| _control over the wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours of work,_  
| _working conditions, other terms of employment, or other_  
| _state-mandated personnel issues, to the extent the public employer_  
| _and the association recognized as the bargaining agent under_  
| _Section 158.074 agree under this subchapter. Applicable statutes,_  
| _local orders, ordinances, and civil service rules and regulations_  
| _apply to an issue not governed by an agreement._  
|  _(b)_ _____This subchapter does not require a public employer or a_  
| _recognized association to meet and confer on any issue or reach an_  
| _agreement._  
|  _(c)_ _____A public employer and a recognized association may meet_  
| _and confer only if the association does not advocate the illegal_  
| _right to strike by public employees._  
|  _(d)_ _____An employee of a sheriff's or constable's department may_  
| _not engage in a strike or organized work stoppage._ ___An employee who_  
| _participates in a strike forfeits all rights, benefits, or_  
| _privileges the employee may have as a result of the person's_  
| _employment or prior employment with the sheriff's department or a_  
| _constable's department, including any civil service or_  
| _reemployment right. This subsection does not affect the right of a_  
| _person to cease work if the person is not acting in concert with_  
| _others in an organized work stoppage._  
|  _Sec._ ___158.074._ _____RECOGNITION OF ASSOCIATION._ ___(a) In a county_  
| _that chooses to meet and confer under this subchapter, the public_  
| _employer shall recognize an association submitting a petition for_  
| _recognition signed by a majority of the employees of the sheriff's_  
| _department or a constable's department, excluding the sheriff or_  
| _constable and persons the sheriff or constable has designated as_  
| _exempt, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the_  
| _employees of the sheriff's or constable's department, excluding the_  
| _sheriff or constable and persons the sheriff or constable has_  
| _designated as exempt, until recognition of the association is_  
| _withdrawn by a majority of the employees eligible to sign a petition_  
| _for recognition._  
|  _(b)_ _____Whether an association represents a majority of covered_  
| _employees must be resolved by an election conducted according to_  
| _procedures agreeable to the parties. If the parties are unable to_  
| _agree on election procedures, either party may request the American_  
| _Arbitration Association to conduct the election and to certify the_  
| _results. Certification of the results of an election under this_  
| _subsection resolves the question concerning representation. An_  
| _association seeking recognition as the sole and exclusive_  
| _bargaining agent is liable for the expenses of the election, except_  
| _that if two or more associations seeking recognition submit_  
| _petitions signed by a majority of the employees eligible to sign the_  
| _petition, the associations shall share equally the costs of the_  
| _election._  
|  _Sec._ ___158.075._ _____OPEN RECORDS._ ___(a) A proposed agreement or_  
| _document prepared and used by a sheriff's or constable's department_  
| _in connection with a proposed agreement shall be available to the_  
| _public under Chapter 552, Government Code, only after the agreement_  
| _is ratified by the commissioners court under Section 158.076._  
|  _(b)_ _____This section does not affect the application of_  
| _Subchapter C, Chapter 552, Government Code, to a document prepared_  
| _and used by a sheriff's or constable's department in connection with_  
| _an agreement._  
|  _Sec._ ___158.076._ _____RATIFICATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF_  
| _AGREEMENT._ ___(a) An agreement under this subchapter is enforceable_  
| _and binding on the public employer, association, and employees_  
| _covered by the agreement only if:_

| _public employer is located ratifies the agreement by a majority_  
| _vote; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the employees in the sheriff's or constable's_  
| _department represented by the association ratify the agreement by_  
| _majority vote using a secret ballot._  
|  _(b)_ _____A district court in the county in which the public_  
| _employer is located has jurisdiction to hear and resolve a dispute_  
| _under a ratified agreement on the application of a party to the_  
| _agreement aggrieved by an action or omission of the other party if_  
| _the action or omission is related to a right, duty, or obligation_  
| _provided by the agreement._ ___The court may issue restraining orders,_  
| _temporary and permanent injunctions, or any other writ, order, or_  
| _process, including contempt orders, that are appropriate to enforce_  
| _the agreement._  
|  _Sec._ ___158.077._ _____AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES CONFLICTING PROVISIONS._  
| _An agreement ratified under this subchapter preempts, during the_

| _service provisions, or rules adopted by the sheriff, a constable,_

| _county and an association, a petition signed by a number of_  
| _registered voters of the county equal to 10 percent of the votes_  
| _cast in the county in the most recent general election may be_  
| _presented to the county clerk requesting an election for the repeal_  
| _of the agreement._  
|  _(b)_ _____On receipt of a petition, the commissioners court shall_  
| _reconsider the agreement and repeal the agreement or call an_  
| _election on the question of whether to repeal the agreement._  
|  _(c)_ _____The election ballot shall be printed to permit voting_  
| _for or against the proposition: "Repeal of an agreement ratified by_  
| _(the county) and (the sheriff's or constable's department_  
| _association) concerning wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours of_  
| _work, working conditions, and other terms of employment."_

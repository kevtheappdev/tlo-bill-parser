|  AN ACT  
| relating to the sales and use tax exemption for certain aircraft.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 151.328(a) and (h), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Aircraft are exempted from the taxes imposed by this  
| chapter if:  
|  (1) sold to a person using the aircraft as a  
| certificated or licensed carrier of persons or property;  
|  (2) sold to a person who:  
|  (A) has a sales tax permit issued under this  
| chapter; and  
|  (B) uses the aircraft for the purpose of  
| providing flight instruction that is:  
|  (i) recognized by the Federal Aviation  
| Administration;  
|  (ii) under the direct or general  
| supervision of a flight instructor certified by the Federal  
| Aviation Administration; and  
|  (iii) designed to lead to a pilot  
| certificate or rating issued by the Federal Aviation Administration  
| or otherwise required by a rule or regulation of the Federal  
| Aviation Administration;  
|  (3) sold to a foreign government;  
|  (4) sold in this state to a person for use and  
| registration in another state or nation before any use in this state  
| other than flight training in the aircraft and the transportation  
| of the aircraft out of this state; or  
|  (5) sold in this state to a person for use exclusively  
| in connection with an agricultural use, as defined by Section  
| 23.51, and used for:  
|  (A) predator control;  
|  (B) wildlife or livestock capture;  
|  (C) wildlife or livestock surveys;  
|  (D) census counts of wildlife or livestock;  
|  (E) animal or plant health inspection services;  
| [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (F) crop dusting, pollination, or seeding _; or_  
|  _(G)_ _____any other use necessary to operate a business_  
| _that performs any service described by Paragraphs (A)-(F)_.  
|  (h) For purposes of the exemption under Subsection (a)(5),  
| an aircraft is considered to be for use exclusively in connection  
| with an agricultural use if 95 percent of the use of the aircraft is  
| for a purpose described by Subsections _(a)(5)(A)-(G)_  
| [ ~~(a)(5)(A)-(F)~~ ]. _Intrastate travel_ [ ~~Travel of less than 30
miles~~  
|  ~~each way~~ ] to a location to perform a service described by  
| Subsections _(a)(5)(A)-(G)_ [ ~~(a)(5)(A)-(F)~~ ] does not disqualify an  
| aircraft from the exemption under Subsection (a)(5). A person who  
| claims an exemption under Subsection (a)(5) must maintain and make  
| available to the comptroller flight records for all uses of the  
| aircraft.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act do not affect  
| tax liability accruing before the effective date of this Act. That  
| liability continues in effect as if this Act had not been enacted,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for the collection of  
| taxes due and for civil and criminal enforcement of the liability  
| for those taxes.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

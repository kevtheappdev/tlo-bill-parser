|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a supplemental payment for certain retirees of the  
| Teacher Retirement System of Texas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) Subject to Section 821.006, Government  
| Code, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall make a one-time  
| supplemental payment of a retirement or death benefit, as provided  
| by this section.  
|  (b) The supplemental payment is payable in September 2019  
| and, to the extent practicable, on a date or dates that coincide  
| with the regular annuity payment payable to each eligible  
| annuitant.  
|  (c) The amount of the supplemental payment is equal to the  
| lesser of:  
|  (1) $2,400; or  
|  (2) the gross amount of the regular annuity payment to  
| which the eligible annuitant is otherwise entitled for the month of  
| August 2019.  
|  (d) The supplemental payment is payable without regard to  
| any forfeiture of benefits under Section 824.601, Government Code.  
| The Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall make applicable tax  
| withholding and other legally required deductions before  
| disbursing the supplemental payment. A supplemental payment under  
| this section is in addition to and not in lieu of the regular  
| monthly annuity payment to which the eligible annuitant is  
| otherwise entitled.  
|  (e) Subject to Subsection (f) of this section, to be  
| eligible for the supplemental payment, a person must be, for the  
| month of August 2019, and disregarding any forfeiture of benefits  
| under Section 824.601, Government Code, an annuitant eligible to  
| receive:  
|  (1) a standard retirement annuity payment;  
|  (2) an optional retirement annuity payment as either a  
| retiree or beneficiary;  
|  (3) a life annuity payment under Section  
| 824.402(a)(4), Government Code;  
|  (4) an annuity for a guaranteed period of 60 months  
| under Section 824.402(a)(3), Government Code; or  
|  (5) an alternate payee annuity payment under Section  
| 804.005, Government Code.  
|  (f) If the annuitant is a retiree or a beneficiary under an  
| optional retirement payment plan, to be eligible for the  
| supplemental payment, the effective date of the retirement of the  
| member of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas must have been on  
| or before August 31, 2015. If the annuitant is a beneficiary under  
| Section 824.402(a)(3) or (4), Government Code, to be eligible for  
| the supplemental payment, the date of death of the member of the  
| retirement system must have been on or before August 31, 2015. The  
| supplemental payment shall be made to an alternate payee who is an  
| annuitant under Section 804.005, Government Code, only if the  
| annuity payment to the alternate payee commenced on or before  
| August 31, 2015. The supplemental payment is in addition to the  
| guaranteed number of payments under Section 824.204(c)(3) or (4),  
| 824.308(c)(3) or (4), or 824.402(a)(3), Government Code, and may  
| not be counted as one of the guaranteed monthly payments.  
|  (g) The supplemental payment does not apply to payments  
| under:  
|  (1) Section 824.304(a), Government Code, relating to  
| disability retirees with less than 10 years of service credit;  
|  (2) Section 824.804(b), Government Code, relating to  
| participants in the deferred retirement option plan with regard to  
| payments from their deferred retirement option plan accounts;  
|  (3) Section 824.501(a), Government Code, relating to  
| retiree survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity in an  
| amount fixed by statute; or  
|  (4) Section 824.404(a), Government Code, relating to  
| active member survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity  
| in an amount fixed by statute.  
|  (h) Except as provided by this section, the board of  
| trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall determine  
| the eligibility for and the amount and timing of a supplemental  
| payment and the manner in which the payment is made.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

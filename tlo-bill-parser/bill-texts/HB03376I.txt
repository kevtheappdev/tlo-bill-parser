| _proposition language that is clear and understandable to the_  
| _average voter for use in the election._  
|  _(h)_ _____Following disapproval under Subsection (g), the_  
| _political subdivision may:_  
|  _(1)_ _____hold the election with the rewritten ballot_  
| _proposition language provided by the panel; or_

| judge of an administrative judicial region shall appoint three

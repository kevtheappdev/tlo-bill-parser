|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a local option exemption from ad valorem taxation by a  
| county of a portion of the value of the residence homestead of a  
| physician who provides health care services for which the physician  
| agrees not to seek payment from any source, including the Medicaid  
| program or otherwise from this state or the federal government, to  
| county residents who are indigent or who are Medicaid recipients.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.13, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsection (i) and adding Subsection (s) to read as follows:  
|  (i) The assessor and collector for a taxing unit may  
| disregard the exemptions authorized by Subsection (b), (c), (d),  
| [ ~~or~~ ] (n) _, or (s)_ [ ~~of this section~~ ] and assess and collect a
tax  
| pledged for payment of debt without deducting the amount of the  
| exemption if:  
|  (1) prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit  
| pledged the taxes for the payment of a debt; and  
|  (2) granting the exemption would impair the obligation  
| of the contract creating the debt.  
|  _(s)_ _____For purposes of this subsection, "qualifying county_  
| _resident"_ ___means a resident of a county that adopts the exemption_  
| _provided by this subsection who is indigent or a Medicaid_  
| _recipient._ ___In addition to any other exemptions provided by this_  
| _section, a licensed physician is entitled to an exemption from_  
| _taxation by a county of a percentage, not to exceed 50 percent, of_  
| _the appraised value of the physician's residence homestead if the_  
| _exemption is adopted by the commissioners court of the county in the_  
| _manner provided by law for official action by the commissioners_  
| _court. To be eligible to receive an exemption under this_  
| _subsection, a physician must provide health care services to_  
| _qualifying county residents and not seek payment for those services_  
| _from any source, including the Medicaid program or otherwise from_  
| _this state or the federal government. The commissioners court_  
| _shall specify in the order adopting the exemption the number of_  
| _qualifying county residents to whom a physician must provide health_  
| _care services during a tax year to be eligible to receive an_  
| _exemption under this subsection. The commissioners court may_  
| _express the number as a percentage of the physician's total_  
| _practice. The commissioners court shall submit to the chief_  
| _appraiser a copy of the order adopting the exemption and any_  
| _subsequent order adopted by the commissioners court that relates to_  
| _the exemption. The chief appraiser may require a physician seeking_  
| _an exemption under this subsection to present additional_  
| _information establishing eligibility for the exemption. The_  
| _commissioners court may repeal the exemption in the manner provided_  
| _by law for official action by the commissioners court._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year that begins on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing a local option exemption from ad  
| valorem taxation by a county of a portion of the value of the  
| residence homestead of a physician who provides health care  
| services for which the physician agrees not to seek payment from any  
| source, including the Medicaid program or otherwise from this state  
| or the federal government, to county residents who are indigent or  
| who are Medicaid recipients is approved by the voters. If that  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

|  SECTION 1. Section 51.0001(2), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (2) "Debtor's last known address" means:  
|  (A) for a debt secured by the debtor's residence,  
| the debtor's residence address unless the debtor provided the  
| mortgage servicer a written change of address before the date the  
| mortgage servicer mailed a notice required by Section 51.002 _or_  
| _51.0022_ ; or  
|  (B) for a debt other than a debt described by  
| Paragraph (A), the debtor's last known address as shown by the  
| records of the mortgage servicer of the security instrument unless  
| the debtor provided the current mortgage servicer a written change  
| of address before the date the mortgage servicer mailed a notice  
| required by Section 51.002 _or 51.0022_.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 51.002(b) and (d), Property Code, are

| the sale will begin, must be given at least 21 days _, or 45 days if_  
| _Section 51.0022(d) or (e) applies,_ before the date of the sale by:

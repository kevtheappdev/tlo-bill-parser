|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the reappraisal for ad valorem tax purposes of property  
| damaged in a disaster.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.02, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 23.02. REAPPRAISAL OF PROPERTY DAMAGED IN DISASTER  
| AREA. (a)  The _chief appraiser of an appraisal district that_  
| _appraises property for_ [ ~~governing body of~~ ] a taxing unit that is  
| located partly or entirely inside an area declared to be a disaster  
| area by the governor _shall reappraise_ [ ~~may authorize reappraisal~~  
|  ~~of~~ ] all property _that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or_  
| _its successor agency estimates to have sustained five percent or_  
| _greater damage as a result of_ [ ~~damaged in~~ ] the disaster at its  
| market value immediately after the disaster.  
|  _(a-1)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a property owner may_  
| _refuse to have the owner's property reappraised under this section._  
|  (b) _The chief appraiser_ [ ~~If a taxing unit authorizes a~~  
|  ~~reappraisal pursuant to this section, the appraisal office~~ ] shall  
| complete the reappraisal _not later than the 45th day after the date_  
| _the governor declares the area to be a disaster area_ [ ~~as soon as~~  
|  ~~practicable~~ ].  
|  _(b-1)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (b), if the Federal_  
| _Emergency Management Agency or its successor agency does not_  
| _complete the damage estimates described by Subsection (a) on or_  
| _before the deadline for completing the reappraisal prescribed by_  
| _Subsection (b), the chief appraiser shall complete the reappraisal_  
| _as soon as practicable after the damage estimates are completed._  
|  _(b-2)_ The _chief appraiser_ [ ~~appraisal office~~ ] shall include  
| on the appraisal records, in addition to other information required  
| or authorized by law:  
|  (1) the date of the disaster; _and_  
|  (2) the appraised value of the property after the  
| disaster[ ~~; and~~  
|  [ ~~(3)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~if the reappraisal is not authorized by all~~  
|  ~~taxing units in which the property is located, an indication of the~~  
|  ~~taxing units to which the reappraisal applies~~ ].  
|  (c) A taxing unit _for which property is reappraised_ [ ~~that~~  
|  ~~authorizes a reappraisal~~ ] under this section must pay the appraisal  
| district all the costs of making the reappraisal. If _property in_  
| _the same territory is reappraised for_ two or more taxing units  
| [ ~~provide for the reappraisal in the same territory~~ ], each _unit_  
| shall share the costs of the reappraisal in that territory in the  
| proportion the total dollar amount of taxes _each unit_ imposed in  
| that territory in the preceding year bears to the total dollar  
| amount of taxes all units [ ~~providing for reappraisal of that~~  
|  ~~territory~~ ] imposed in _that territory in_ the preceding year.  
|  (d) If property damaged in a disaster is reappraised _for a_  
| _taxing unit_ as provided by this section, the governing body _of the_  
| _taxing unit_ shall provide for prorating the taxes on the property  
| for the year in which the disaster occurred. _The_ [ ~~If the taxes are~~ ]  
| prorated[ ~~,~~ ] taxes due on the property are determined as follows:  
| the taxes on the property based on its value on January 1 of that  
| year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365  
| and the numerator of which is the number of days before the date the  
| disaster occurred; the taxes on the property based on its  
| reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of  
| which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days,  
| including the date the disaster occurred, remaining in the year;  
| and the total of the two amounts is the amount of taxes on the  
| property for the year.  
|  _(e)_ _____The comptroller may adopt rules to implement and_  
| _administer this section._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the reappraisal of property located in an area that is declared  
| to be a disaster area by the governor on or after the effective date  
| of this Act. The reappraisal of property located in an area that  
| was declared to be a disaster area by the governor before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law as it existed  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

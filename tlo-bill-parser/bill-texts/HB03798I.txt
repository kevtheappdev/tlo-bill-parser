| intent of Chapter 382, Health and Safety Code. The commission  
| shall:  
|  (1) revise the air quality models and, if necessary,  
| any relevant permit requirements if the commission determines from

| intent of Chapter 382, Health and Safety Code; and  
|  (2) adopt a standard audit and air sampling program as  
| authorized under Section 382.069(b), Health and Safety Code, as  
| added by this Act, if the commission determines from the assessment  
| that such a program is necessary to accomplish the intent of Chapter  
| 382, Health and Safety Code.

|  SECTION 7. (a) Section 6(a) of this Act does not prohibit  
| the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality from granting an  
| application for a permit that is filed before the effective date of  
| this Act.  
|  (b) Sections 382.0516(c) and 382.069(d), Health and Safety  
| Code, as added by this Act, and Sections 382.056(r) and 382.065,  
| Health and Safety Code, as amended by this Act, apply only to an  
| application for a permit that is filed with the Texas Commission on  
| Environmental Quality on or after the effective date of this Act. An  
| application for a permit filed before the effective date of this Act  
| is governed by the law in effect on the date of filing, and that law  
| is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 8. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

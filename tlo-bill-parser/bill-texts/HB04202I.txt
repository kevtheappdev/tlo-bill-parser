|  AN ACT  
| relating to the authority of a court to grant a motion for a new  
| trial in certain criminal cases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 40, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Article 40.002 to read as follows:  
|  _Art._ ___40.002._ _____NEW TRIAL ON MOTION BY AGREEMENT OF PARTIES._  
| _(a) At any time during the period of a term of imprisonment of more_  
| _than three years or at any time after the imposition of the penalty_  
| _of death, a defendant may, with the written consent of the attorney_  
| _representing the state, file a motion for a new trial with the_  
| _convicting court. The court may, after a hearing, grant the_  
| _defendant a new trial in the interest of justice._  
|  _(b)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a defendant who is_  
| _granted a new trial under this article may be prosecuted and_  
| _punished in accordance with the statutory provisions criminalizing_  
| _and prescribing punishment for the applicable conduct that were in_  
| _effect at the time the conduct occurred or under the applicable_  
| _statutory provisions in effect at the time the new trial is granted._  
|  _(c)_ _____Neither the attorney representing the state nor the_  
| _defendant is entitled to make an interlocutory appeal from the_  
| _court's decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial under_  
| _this article._  
|  _(d)_ _____The attorney representing the state may condition the_  
| _attorney's consent to a motion for a new trial on any appropriate_  
| _reason, including a requirement that the defendant:_  
|  _(1) plead guilty and accept a specific punishment;_  
|  _(2)_ _____waive the defendant's parole eligibility as part_  
| _of any punishment agreement; or_  
|  _(3) waive the defendant's right to appeal._  
|  _(e)_ _____Until the trial court has granted the motion under this_  
| _article, the defendant may withdraw the motion or the attorney_  
| _representing the state may withdraw consent to the motion. If the_  
| _motion or consent is withdrawn, the court may not grant a new trial_  
| _in the case based on that motion._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 5, Article 11.07, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 5. The Court of Criminal Appeals may deny relief upon  
| the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge without docketing  
| the cause, or may direct that the cause be docketed and heard as  
| though originally presented to said court or as an appeal. Upon  
| reviewing the record the court shall enter its judgment remanding  
| the applicant to custody or ordering his release, as the law and  
| facts may justify. The mandate of the court shall issue to the  
| court issuing the writ, as in other criminal cases. After  
| conviction _, except as otherwise provided by Article 40.002,_ the  
| procedure outlined in this _article_ [ ~~Act~~ ] shall be exclusive and any  
| other proceeding shall be void and of no force and effect in  
| discharging the prisoner.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 1, Article 11.071, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 1. APPLICATION TO DEATH PENALTY CASE.  Notwithstanding  
| any other provision of this chapter, this article establishes the  
| procedures for an application for a writ of habeas corpus in which  
| the applicant seeks relief from a judgment imposing a penalty of  
| death. _This article does not affect the authority of a court to_  
| _grant a motion for a new trial under Article 40.002._  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

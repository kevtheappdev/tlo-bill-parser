| _determine whether the child meets the level of care criteria for_  
| _medical necessity for nursing facility care only if the child has a_

| _reassessment be made annually._  
|  _(b)_ _____If federal law requires that a reassessment of a child_

| _program to determine whether the child meets the level of care_

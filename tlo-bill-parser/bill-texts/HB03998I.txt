|  SECTION 11. Sections 11.023(a) and (e), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) To the extent that state water has not been set aside by  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under Section 11.1471(a)(2) to meet  
| downstream instream flow needs or freshwater inflow needs, state  
| water may be appropriated, stored, or diverted for:  
|  (1) domestic and municipal uses, including water for  
| sustaining human life and the life of domestic animals;  
|  (2) agricultural uses and industrial uses, meaning  
| processes designed to convert materials of a lower order of value

| and, to the extent practicable, provide for the freshwater inflows  
| and instream flows necessary to maintain the viability of the  
| state's streams, rivers, and bay and estuary systems in the _board's_  
| [ ~~commission's~~ ] regular granting of permits for the use of state  
| waters. As an essential part of the state's environmental flows  
| policy, all permit conditions relating to freshwater inflows to  
| affected bays and estuaries and instream flow needs must be subject  
| to temporary suspension if necessary for water to be applied to  
| essential beneficial uses during emergencies.  
|  (d-3) The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) in those basins in which water is available for  
| appropriation, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] should establish an  
| environmental set-aside below which water should not be available  
| for appropriation; and  
|  (2) in those basins in which the unappropriated water  
| that will be set aside for instream flow and freshwater inflow  
| protection is not sufficient to fully satisfy the environmental  
| flow standards established by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], a variety of  
| market approaches, both public and private, for filling the gap  
| must be explored and pursued.  
|  SECTION 13. Sections 11.0236(h) and (m), Water Code, are

| Section 11.1471 for all of the river basin and bay systems in this  
| state.  
|  SECTION 14. Sections 11.02361(e) and (f), Water Code, are

| to the science of environmental flow protection; and  
|  (2) develop recommendations to help provide overall  
| direction, coordination, and consistency relating to:  
|  (A) environmental flow methodologies for bay and  
| estuary studies and instream flow studies;  
|  (B) environmental flow programs at the _board and_  
| [ ~~commission,~~ ] the Parks and Wildlife Department[ ~~, and the board~~
];  
| and  
|  (C) the work of the basin and bay expert science  
| teams described in Section 11.02362.  
|  (f) To assist the advisory group to assess the extent to  
| which the recommendations of the science advisory committee are  
| considered and implemented, the _board and_ [ ~~commission,~~ ] the Parks  
| and Wildlife Department[ ~~, and the board~~ ] shall provide written  
| reports to the advisory group, at intervals determined by the  
| advisory group, that describe:  
|  (1) the actions taken by each agency in response to  
| each recommendation; and  
|  (2) for each recommendation not implemented, the

| ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS OR BAY AND ESTUARY INFLOWS. (a) The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may not issue a new permit for instream flows  
| dedicated to environmental needs or bay and estuary inflows. The  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may approve an application to amend an existing  
| permit or certificate of adjudication to change the use to or add a  
| use for instream flows dedicated to environmental needs or bay and  
| estuary inflows.

| diverted, or otherwise used state water during the preceding  
| calendar year shall submit a written report to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] on a form prescribed by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ].
The  
| report shall contain all information required by the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] to aid in administering the water law and in making  
| inventory of the state's water resources. However, with the

| available to the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] on the _board's_ [
~~commission's~~ ]  
| request. The executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] shall establish a  
| reasonable deadline by which a person must make available  
| information requested by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under this

|  (a) Under rules prescribed by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], a  
| person, association of persons, corporation, water control and  
| improvement district, water improvement district, or irrigation  
| district supplying stored or conserved water under contract as  
| provided in this chapter may use the bank and bed of any flowing  
| natural stream in the state to convey the water from the place of  
| storage to the place of use or to the diversion point of the  
| appropriator.  
|  (a-1) With prior authorization granted under rules  
| prescribed by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], a person, association of  
| persons, corporation, water control and improvement district,  
| water improvement district, or irrigation district supplying water  
| imported from a source located wholly outside the boundaries of  
| this state, except water imported from a source located in the  
| United Mexican States, may use the bed and banks of any flowing  
| natural stream in the state to convey water for use in this state.  
| The authorization must:  
|  (1) allow for the diversion of only the amount of water  
| put into a watercourse or stream, less carriage losses; and  
|  (2) include special conditions adequate to prevent a  
| significant impact to the quality of water in this state.  
|  (b) A person who wishes to discharge and then subsequently  
| divert and reuse the person's existing return flows derived from  
| privately owned groundwater must obtain prior authorization from  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] for the diversion and the reuse of these  
| return flows. The authorization may allow for the diversion and  
| reuse by the discharger of existing return flows, less carriage  
| losses, and shall be subject to special conditions if necessary to  
| protect an existing water right that was granted based on the use or  
| availability of these return flows. Special conditions may also be  
| provided to help maintain instream uses and freshwater inflows to  
| bays and estuaries. A person wishing to divert and reuse future  
| increases of return flows derived from privately owned groundwater  
| must obtain authorization to reuse increases in return flows before  
| the increase.  
|  (c) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (a) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], a person who wishes to convey and subsequently divert  
| water in a watercourse or stream must obtain the prior approval of  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] through a bed and banks authorization. The  
| authorization shall allow to be diverted only the amount of water  
| put into a watercourse or stream, less carriage losses and subject  
| to any special conditions that may address the impact of the  
| discharge, conveyance, and diversion on existing permits,  
| certified filings, or certificates of adjudication, instream uses,  
| and freshwater inflows to bays and estuaries. Water discharged  
| into a watercourse or stream under this chapter shall not cause a  
| degradation of water quality to the extent that the stream  
| segment's classification would be lowered. [ ~~Authorizations under~~  
|  ~~this section and water quality authorizations may be approved in a~~  
|  ~~consolidated permit proceeding.~~ ]  
|  _(e)_ _____The board may consult with the commission in determining_  
| _special conditions for an authorization issued under this section._  
|  SECTION 23. Section 11.046(b), Water Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) In granting an application for a water right, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may include conditions in the water right providing  
| for the return of surplus water, in a specific amount or percentage  
| of water diverted, and the return point on a watercourse or stream  
| as necessary to protect senior downstream permits, certified  
| filings, or certificates of adjudication or to provide flows for  
| instream uses or bays and estuaries.  
|  SECTION 24. Section 11.053, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.053. EMERGENCY ORDER CONCERNING WATER RIGHTS. (a)  
| During a period of drought or other emergency shortage of water, as

| rights established by Section 11.027:  
|  (1) temporarily suspend the right of any person who  
| holds a water right to use the water; and  
|  (2) temporarily adjust the diversions of water by  
| water rights holders.  
|  (b) The executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] in ordering a  
| suspension or adjustment under this section shall ensure that an  
| action taken:  
|  (1) maximizes the beneficial use of water;  
|  (2) minimizes the impact on water rights holders;  
|  (3) prevents the waste of water;  
|  (4) takes into consideration the efforts of the  
| affected water rights holders to develop and implement the water  
| conservation plans and drought contingency plans required by this  
| chapter;  
|  (5) to the greatest extent practicable, conforms to  
| the order of preferences established by Section 11.024; and  
|  (6) does not require the release of water that, at the  
| time the order is issued, is lawfully stored in a reservoir under  
| water rights associated with that reservoir.  
|  (c) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall adopt rules to implement  
| this section, including rules:  
|  (1) defining a drought or other emergency shortage of  
| water for purposes of this section; and  
|  (2) specifying the:  
|  (A) conditions under which the executive

|  SECTION 25. Section 11.084, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.084. SALE OF PERMANENT WATER RIGHT WITHOUT A  
| PERMIT. No person may sell or offer to sell a permanent water right  
| unless _the person_ [ ~~he~~ ] has perfected a right to appropriate state  
| water by a certified filing, or unless _the person_ [ ~~he~~ ] has obtained  
| a permit from the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], authorizing the use of the  
| water for the purposes for which the permanent water right is  
| conveyed.  
|  SECTION 26. Section 11.0841(c), Water Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) For purposes of this section, the Parks and Wildlife  
| Department has:  
|  (1) the rights of a holder of a water right that is  
| held in the Texas Water Trust, including the right to file suit in a  
| civil court to prevent the unlawful use of such a right;  
|  (2) the right to act in the same manner that a holder  
| of a water right may act to protect the holder's rights in seeking  
| to prevent any person from appropriating water in violation of a  
| set-aside established by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under Section  
| 11.1471 to meet instream flow needs or freshwater inflow needs; and  
|  (3) the right to file suit in a civil court to prevent  
| the unlawful use of a set-aside established under Section 11.1471.  
|  SECTION 27. Sections 11.0842(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f),  
| (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), and (p), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) If a person violates this chapter, a rule or order  
| adopted under this chapter [ ~~or Section 16.236~~ ], or a permit,  
| certified filing, or certificate of adjudication issued under this  
| chapter, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may assess an administrative  
| penalty against that person as provided by this section. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may assess an administrative penalty for a violation  
| relating to a water division or a river basin or segment of a river  
| basin regardless of whether a watermaster has been appointed for  
| the water division or river basin or segment of the river basin.  
|  (b) The penalty may be in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for  
| each day the person is in violation of this chapter, the rule or  
| order adopted under this chapter, or the permit, certified filing,  
| or certificate of adjudication issued under this chapter. [ ~~The~~  
|  ~~penalty may be in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each day the~~  
|  ~~person is in violation of the rule or order adopted under Section~~  
|  ~~16.236 of this code.~~ ] Each day a violation continues may be  
| considered a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment.  
|  (c) In determining the amount of the penalty, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider:  
|  (1) the nature, circumstances, extent, duration, and  
| gravity of the prohibited acts, with special emphasis on the  
| impairment of an existing permit, certified filing, or certificate  
| of adjudication or the hazard or potential hazard created to the  
| health, safety, or welfare of the public;  
|  (2) the impact of the violation on the instream uses,  
| water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, or beneficial freshwater  
| inflows to bays and estuaries;  
|  (3) with respect to the alleged violator:  
|  (A) the history and extent of previous  
| violations;  
|  (B) the degree of culpability, including whether  
| the violation was attributable to mechanical or electrical failures  
| and whether the violation could have been reasonably anticipated  
| and avoided;  
|  (C) demonstrated good faith, including actions  
| taken by the alleged violator to rectify the cause of the violation  
| and to compensate affected persons;  
|  (D) any economic benefit gained through the  
| violation; and  
|  (E) the amount necessary to deter future  
| violations; and  
|  (4) any other matters that justice may require.  
|  (d) If, after examination of a possible violation and the  
| facts surrounding that possible violation, the executive  
| _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] concludes that a violation has occurred,  
| the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] shall issue a preliminary  
| report stating the facts on which that conclusion was based,  
| recommending that an administrative penalty under this section be  
| imposed on the person charged, and recommending the amount of the  
| penalty. The executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] shall base the  
| recommended amount of the proposed penalty on the factors provided  
| by Subsection (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ] and shall analyze each factor  
| for the benefit of the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ].  
|  (e) No later than the 10th day after the date on which the  
| report is issued, the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] shall give  
| written notice of the report to the person charged with the  
| violation. The notice shall include a brief summary of the charges,  
| a statement of the amount of the penalty recommended, and a  
| statement of the right of the person charged to a hearing on the  
| occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the  
| occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.  
|  (f) No later than the 20th day after the date on which notice  
| is received, the person charged may either give to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] written consent to the executive _administrator's_  
| [ ~~director's~~ ] report, including the recommended penalty, or make a  
| written request for a hearing.  
|  (g) If the person charged with the violation consents to the  
| penalty recommended by the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] or  
| fails to timely respond to the notice, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] by  
| order shall either assess the penalty or order a hearing to be held  
| on the findings and recommendations in the executive  
| _administrator's_ [ ~~director's~~ ] report. If the _board_ [ ~~commission~~
]  
| assesses the penalty recommended by the report, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall give written notice of its decision to the  
| person charged.  
|  (h) If the person charged requests or the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| orders a hearing, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall call a hearing and  
| give notice of the hearing. As a result of the hearing, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] by order either may find that a violation has occurred  
| and may assess a penalty, may find that a violation has occurred but  
| that no penalty should be assessed, or may find that no violation  
| has occurred. All proceedings under this subsection are subject to  
| Chapter 2001, Government Code. In making any penalty decision, the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall analyze each of the factors provided by  
| Subsection (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ].  
|  (i) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall give notice of its decision  
| to the person charged, and if the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] finds that a  
| violation has occurred and assesses an administrative penalty, the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall give written notice to the person charged  
| of its findings, of the amount of the penalty, and of the person's  
| right to judicial review of the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] order. If  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] is required to give notice of a penalty under  
| this subsection or Subsection (g) [ ~~of this section~~ ], the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall file notice of its decision in the Texas  
| Register not later than the 10th day after the date on which the  
| decision is adopted.  
|  (j) Within the 30-day period immediately following the day  
| on which the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] order is final, as provided by  
| Subchapter F, Chapter 2001, Government Code, the person charged  
| with the penalty shall:  
|  (1) pay the penalty in full;  
|  (2) pay the amount of the penalty and file a petition  
| for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the  
| amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and  
| the amount of the penalty; or  
|  (3) without paying the amount of the penalty, file a  
| petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the  
| violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the  
| violation and the amount of the penalty.  
|  (k) Within the 30-day period, a person who acts under  
| Subsection (j)(3) [ ~~of this section~~ ] may:  
|  (1) stay enforcement of the penalty by:  
|  (A) paying the amount of the penalty to the court  
| for placement in an escrow account; or  
|  (B) giving to the court a supersedeas bond that  
| is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is  
| effective until all judicial review of the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ]  
| order is final; or  
|  (2) request the court to stay enforcement of the  
| penalty by:  
|  (A) filing with the court a sworn affidavit of  
| the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the  
| amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the  
| supersedeas bond; and  
|  (B) giving a copy of the affidavit to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] by certified mail.  
|  (l) If the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] receives a copy of an  
| affidavit under Subsection (k)(2) [ ~~of this section~~ ], it may file  
| with the court within five days after the date the copy is received  
| a contest to the affidavit. The court shall hold a hearing on the  
| facts alleged in the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay  
| the enforcement of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are  
| true. The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving  
| that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the  
| penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.  
|  (m) If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and  
| the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may refer the matter to the attorney general for  
| collection of the amount of the penalty.  
|  (n) Judicial review of the order or decision of the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] assessing the penalty shall be under the substantial  
| evidence rule and shall be instituted by filing a petition with a  
| district court in Travis County, as provided by Subchapter G,  
| Chapter 2001, Government Code.  
|  (p) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may compromise, modify, or remit, with or  
| without condition, any penalty imposed under this section.  
|  SECTION 28. Sections 11.0843(a) and (b), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Upon witnessing a violation of this chapter or a rule or  
| order or a water right issued under this chapter, the executive  
| _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] or a person designated by the executive  
| _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ], including a watermaster or the  
| watermaster's deputy, may issue the alleged violator a field  
| citation alleging that a violation has occurred and providing the  
| alleged violator the option of either:  
|  (1) without admitting to or denying the alleged  
| violation, paying an administrative penalty in accordance with the  
| predetermined penalty amount established under Subsection (b) and  
| taking remedial action as provided in the citation; or  
|  (2) requesting a hearing on the alleged violation in  
| accordance with Section 11.0842.  
|  (b) By rule the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall establish penalty  
| amounts corresponding to types of violations of this chapter or  
| rules or orders adopted or water rights issued under this chapter.  
|  SECTION 29. Subchapter C, Chapter 11, Water Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 11.0844 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___11.0844._ _____INJUNCTIVE RELIEF._ ___(a)_ ___The executive_  
| _administrator may enforce a board rule adopted under this chapter_

|  _(b)_ _____If it appears that a violation or threat of violation of_  
| _this chapter or a rule adopted or an order or a permit issued under_  
| _this chapter has occurred or is about to occur, the executive_  
| _administrator may have a suit instituted in district court for_  
| _injunctive relief to restrain the violation or threat of violation._  
|  _(c)_ _____The suit may be brought in the county in which the_  
| _defendant resides or in the county in which the violation or threat_  
| _of violation occurs._  
|  _(d)_ _____In a suit brought under this section to enjoin a_  
| _violation or threat of violation described by Subsection (b), the_  
| _court may grant the board, without bond or other undertaking, any_  
| _prohibitory or mandatory injunction the facts may warrant,_  
| _including a temporary restraining order and, after notice and_  
| _hearing, a temporary injunction or permanent injunction._  
|  _(e)_ _____On request of the executive administrator, the attorney_  
| _general or the prosecuting attorney in a county in which the_  
| _violation occurs shall initiate a suit in the name of the state for_  
| _injunctive relief. The suit may be brought independently of or in_  
| _conjunction with a suit under Section 11.082._  
|  SECTION 30. Sections 11.085(a), (d), (e), (i), (j), (k),  
| (l), and (m), Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) No person may take or divert any state water from a river  
| basin in this state and transfer such water to any other river basin  
| without first applying for and receiving a water right or an  
| amendment to a permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication from the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] authorizing the transfer.  
|  (d) Prior to taking action on an application for an  
| interbasin transfer, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall conduct at least  
| one public meeting to receive comments in both the basin of origin  
| of the water proposed for transfer and the basin receiving water  
| from the proposed transfer. Notice shall be provided pursuant to  
| Subsection (g) [ ~~of this section~~ ]. Any person may present relevant  
| information and data at the meeting on the criteria which the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] is to consider related to the interbasin transfer.  
|  (e) In addition to the public meetings required by  
| Subsection (d), if the application is contested in a manner  
| requiring an evidentiary hearing under the rules of the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ], the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall give notice and
hold an  
| evidentiary hearing, in accordance with _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] rules  
| and applicable state law. An evidentiary hearing on an application  
| to transfer water authorized under an existing water right is  
| limited to considering issues related to the requirements of this  
| section.  
|  (i) The applicant shall pay the cost of notice required to  
| be provided under this section. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] by rule may

| comment only after seeking advice from the county commissioners  
| court; and  
|  (2) give consideration to the comments of each county  
| judge of a county located in whole or in part in the basin of origin  
| prior to taking action on an application for an interbasin  
| transfer.  
|  (k) In addition to other requirements of this code relating  
| to the review of and action on an application for a new water right  
| or amended permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall weigh the effects of the  
| proposed transfer by considering:  
|  (1) [ ~~the need for the water in the basin of origin and~~  
|  ~~in the proposed receiving basin based on the period for which the~~  
|  ~~water supply is requested, but not to exceed 50 years;~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~factors identified in the applicable approved~~  
|  ~~regional water plans which address the following:~~  
|  [ ~~(A)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the availability of feasible and~~  
|  ~~practicable alternative supplies in the receiving basin to the~~  
|  ~~water proposed for transfer;~~  
|  [ ~~(B)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the amount and purposes of use in the~~  
|  ~~receiving basin for which water is needed;~~  
|  [ ~~(C)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~proposed methods and efforts by the~~  
|  ~~receiving basin to avoid waste and implement water conservation and~~  
|  ~~drought contingency measures;~~  
|  [ ~~(D)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~proposed methods and efforts by the~~  
|  ~~receiving basin to put the water proposed for transfer to~~  
|  ~~beneficial use;~~  
|  [ ~~(E)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the projected economic impact that is~~  
|  ~~reasonably expected to occur in each basin as a result of the~~  
|  ~~transfer; and~~  
|  [ ~~(F)~~ ] the projected impacts of the proposed  
| transfer that are reasonably expected to occur on [ ~~existing water~~  
|  ~~rights,~~ ] instream uses, water quality, aquatic and riparian  
| habitat, and bays and estuaries that must be assessed under  
| Sections 11.147, 11.150, and 11.152 [ ~~of this code~~ ] in each basin.  
| If the water sought to be transferred is currently authorized to be  
| used under an existing permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication, such impacts shall only be considered in relation to  
| that portion of the permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication proposed for transfer and shall be based on historical  
| uses of the permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication for which amendment is sought;  
|  [ ~~(3)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~proposed mitigation or compensation, if any, to~~  
|  ~~the basin of origin by the applicant;~~  
|  [ ~~(4)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the continued need to use the water for the~~  
|  ~~purposes authorized under the existing permit, certified filing, or~~  
|  ~~certificate of adjudication, if an amendment to an existing water~~  
|  ~~right is sought;~~ ] and  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~(5)~~ ] the information required to be submitted by  
| the applicant.  
|  (l) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may grant, in whole or in part,  
| an application for an interbasin transfer only to the extent that:  
|  (1) the detriments to the basin of origin during the  
| proposed transfer period are less than the benefits to the  
| receiving basin during the proposed transfer period, as determined  
| by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] based on consideration of the factors  
| described by Subsection (k); and  
|  (2) the applicant for the interbasin transfer has  
| prepared a drought contingency plan and has developed and  
| implemented a water conservation plan that will result in the  
| highest practicable levels of water conservation and efficiency  
| achievable within the jurisdiction of the applicant.  
|  (m) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may grant new or amended water  
| rights under this section with or without specific terms or periods  
| of use and with specific conditions under which a transfer of water  
| may occur.  
|  SECTION 31. Sections 11.087(b) and (c), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may make and enforce rules and  
| orders to implement the provisions of this section, including rules  
| and orders designed to:  
|  (1) establish an orderly system for water releases and  
| diversions in order to protect vested rights and to avoid the loss  
| of released water;  
|  (2) prescribe the time that releases of water may  
| begin and end;  
|  (3) determine the proportionate quantities of the  
| released water in transit and the water that would have been flowing  
| in the stream without the addition of the released water;  
|  (4) require each owner or operator of a dam or  
| reservoir on the stream between the point of release and the point  
| of destination to allow free passage of the released water in  
| transit; and  
|  (5) establish other requirements the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] considers necessary to effectuate the purposes of this  
| section.  
|  (c) Orders made by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] to effectuate its  
| rules under this section shall be mailed by certified mail to each  
| diverter of water and to each reservoir owner on the stream between  
| the point of release and the point of destination of the released  
| water as shown by the records of the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ].  
|  SECTION 32. Section 11.0871, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.0871. TEMPORARY DIVERSION OF WATER ON INTERNATIONAL  
| STREAM. (a) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may authorize, under  
| conditions stated in an order, a watermaster to provide for the  
| temporary diversion and use by holders of water rights of storm  
| water or floodwater that spills from dams and reservoirs on an  
| international stream and otherwise would flow into the Gulf of  
| Mexico without opportunity for beneficial use.  
|  (b) In an order made by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under this  
| section, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may not discriminate between  
| holders of water rights from an international stream except to the  
| extent necessary to protect the holders of water rights from the  
| same source of supply.  
|  (c) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall give notice by mail to

| of water, nor may it be for a term in excess of one year.  
|  (b) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may prescribe rules governing  
| notice and procedure for the issuance of temporary permits.  
|  (d) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may not issue a temporary permit  
| for a period exceeding three calendar years.  
|  (f) A temporary permit expires and shall be cancelled by the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] in accordance with the terms of the permit.  
|  (g) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may prescribe by rule the fees to  
| be paid for issuance of temporary permits, but no fee for issuance  
| or extension of a temporary permit shall exceed $500.  
|  SECTION 56. Sections 11.1381(a), (b), and (c), Water Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Until a water right is perfected to the full extent  
| provided by Section 11.026 [ ~~of this code~~ ], the _board_ [
~~commission~~ ]  
| may issue permits for a term of years for use of state water to which  
| a senior water right has not been perfected.  
|  (b) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall refuse to grant an  
| application for a permit under this section if the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the  
| issuance of the permit will jeopardize financial commitments made  
| for water projects that have been built or that are being built to  
| optimally develop the water resources of the area.  
|  (c) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall refuse to grant an  
| application for a term permit if the holder of the senior  
| appropriative water right can demonstrate that the issuance of the  
| term permit would prohibit the senior appropriative water right  
| holder from beneficially using the senior rights during the term of  
| the term permit. Such demonstration will be made using reasonable  
| projections based on accepted methods.  
|  SECTION 57. Sections 11.139(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f),  
| (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k), Water Code, are amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) Except as provided by Section 11.148 [ ~~of this code~~ ], the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may grant an emergency permit, order, or  
| amendment to an existing permit, certified filing, or certificate  
| of adjudication after notice to the governor for an initial period  
| of not more than 120 days if the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] finds that  
| emergency conditions exist which present an imminent threat to the  
| public health and safety and which override the necessity to comply  
| with established statutory procedures and there are no feasible  
| practicable alternatives to the emergency authorization. Such  
| emergency action may be renewed once for not longer than 60 days.  
|  (b) A person desiring to obtain an emergency authorization  
| under this section shall submit to the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] a sworn  
| application containing the following information:  
|  (1) a description of the condition of emergency  
| justifying the granting of the emergency authorization;  
|  (2) a statement setting forth facts which support the  
| findings required under this section;  
|  (3) an estimate of the dates on which the proposed  
| authorization should begin and end;  
|  (4) a description of the action sought and the  
| activity proposed to be allowed, mandated, or prohibited; and  
|  (5) any other statements or information required by  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ].  
|  (c) If the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] finds the applicant's  
| statement made under Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ] to be  
| correct, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may grant emergency authorizations  
| under this section without notice and hearing or with such notice  
| and hearing as the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] considers practicable under  
| the circumstances.  
|  (d) If the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] grants an emergency  
| authorization under this section without a hearing, the  
| authorization shall fix a time and place for a hearing to be held  
| before the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]. The hearing shall be held as soon  
| after the emergency authorization is granted as is practicable but  
| not later than 20 days after the emergency authorization is  
| granted.  
|  (e) At the hearing, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall affirm,  
| modify, or set aside the emergency authorization. Any hearing on an  
| emergency authorization shall be conducted in accordance with  
| Chapter 2001, Government Code, and rules of the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ].  
|  (f) If an imminent threat to the public health and safety  
| exists which requires emergency action before the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] can take action as provided by Subsections (a) through  
| (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ] and there are no feasible alternatives, the  
| executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] may grant an emergency  
| authorization after notice to the governor. If the executive  
| _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] issues an emergency authorization under  
| this subsection, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall hold a hearing as  
| provided for in Subsections (d) and (e) [ ~~of this section~~ ]. The  
| requirements of Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ] shall be satisfied  
| by the applicant before action is taken by the executive  
| _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] on the request for emergency  
| authorization.  
|  (g) The requirements of Section 11.132 [ ~~of this code~~ ]  
| relating to the time for notice, newspaper notice, and method of  
| giving a person notice do not apply to a hearing held on an  
| application for an emergency authorization under this section, but  
| such general notice of the hearing shall be given as the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ], under Subsections (c) and (e) [ ~~of this section~~ ],  
| considers practicable under the circumstances.  
|  (h) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may grant an emergency  
| authorization under this section for the temporary transfer and use  
| of all or part of a permit, certified filing, or certificate of  
| adjudication for other than domestic or municipal use to a retail or  
| wholesale water supplier for public health and safety purposes. In  
| addition to the requirements contained in Subsection (b) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may direct that the applicant
will  
| timely pay the amounts for which the applicant may be potentially  
| liable under Subsection (j) [ ~~of this section~~ ] and to the extent  
| authorized by law will fully indemnify and hold harmless the state,  
| the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ], and the _board_ [
~~commission~~ ]  
| from any and all liability for the authorization sought. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may order bond or other surety in a form acceptable to  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] as a condition for such emergency  
| authorization. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may not grant an emergency  
| authorization under this section which would cause a violation of a  
| federal regulation.  
|  (i) In transferring the amount of water requested by the  
| applicant, the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] or the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall allocate the requested amount among two or more  
| permits, certified filings, or certificates of adjudication for  
| other than domestic or municipal use.  
|  (j) The person granted an emergency authorization under  
| Subsection (h) [ ~~of this section~~ ] is liable to the owner and the  
| owner's agent or lessee from whom the use is transferred for the  
| fair market value of the water transferred as well as for any  
| damages caused by the transfer of use. If, within 60 days of the  
| termination of the authorization, the parties do not agree on the  
| amount due, or if full payment is not made, either party may file a  
| complaint with the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] to determine the amount due.  
| The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may use dispute resolution procedures for a  
| complaint filed under this subsection. After exhausting all  
| administrative remedies under this subsection, an owner from whom  
| the use is transferred may file suit to recover or determine the  
| amount due in a district court in the county where the owner resides  
| or has its headquarters. The prevailing party in a suit filed under  
| this subsection is entitled to recover court costs and reasonable  
| attorney's fees.  
|  (k) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may prescribe rules and adopt  
| fees which are necessary to carry out the provisions of this  
| section.  
|  SECTION 58. Section 11.140, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.140. PERMITS FOR STORAGE FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT.  
| The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may issue permits for storage solely for the  
| purpose of optimum development of projects. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| may convert these permits to permits for beneficial use if  
| application to have them converted is made to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ].  
|  SECTION 59. Sections 11.1405(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g),  
| and (h), Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may issue a permit under this  
| section to authorize a diversion of state water from the Gulf of  
| Mexico or a bay or arm of the Gulf of Mexico for desalination and use  
| for industrial purposes if:  
|  (1) the point of diversion is located less than three  
| miles seaward of any point located on the coast of this state; or  
|  (2) the seawater contains a total dissolved solids  
| concentration based on a yearly average of samples taken monthly at  
| the water source of less than 20,000 milligrams per liter.  
|  (c) A person who diverts and uses state water that consists  
| of marine seawater under a permit issued under Subsection (a) or as  
| authorized by Subsection (b) must determine the total dissolved  
| solids concentration of the seawater at the water source by monthly  
| sampling and analysis and provide the data collected to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ]. A person may not begin construction of a facility for  
| the diversion of marine seawater for the purposes provided by this  
| section without obtaining a permit until the person has provided  
| data to the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] based on the analysis of samples  
| taken at the water source over a period of at least one year  
| demonstrating that Subsection (a)(2) does not apply. A person who  
| has begun construction of a facility for the diversion of marine  
| seawater for the purposes provided by this section without  
| obtaining a permit because the person has demonstrated that  
| Subsection (a)(2) does not apply is not required to obtain a permit  
| for the facility if the total dissolved solids concentration of the  
| seawater at the water source subsequently changes so that  
| Subsection (a)(2) applies.  
|  (d) A permit application under this section must be  
| submitted as required by _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] rule.  
|  (e) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] is not required to make a finding  
| of water availability for an application under this section.  
|  (f) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall evaluate whether any  
| proposed diversion under this section is consistent with any  
| applicable environmental flow standards established under Section  
| 11.1471.  
|  (g) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may include any provision in a  
| permit issued under this section that the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| considers necessary to comply with the environmental flow standards  
| established under Section 11.1471.  
|  (h) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall adopt rules providing an  
| expedited procedure for acting on an application for a permit under  
| Subsection (a). The rules must provide for notice, an opportunity  
| for the submission of written comment, and an opportunity for a  
| contested case hearing regarding _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] actions  
| relating to an application for a permit.  
|  SECTION 60. Section 11.141, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.141. DATE OF PRIORITY. When the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| issues a permit, the priority of the appropriation of water and the  
| claimant's right to use the water date from the date of filing of  
| the application.  
|  SECTION 61. Sections 11.1421(c), (d), and (e), Water Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) Before a person first takes water under Subsection (b)  
| [ ~~of this section~~ ], the person must give notice to the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] of the proposed appropriation.  
|  (d) Each appropriation of water made under Subsection (b)  
| [ ~~of this section~~ ] shall be reported to the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]
in the  
| manner provided by the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] rules.  
|  (e) After notice and hearing, if the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| determines that as a result of low freshwater inflows appropriation  
| of water under Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ] would interfere  
| with natural productivity of bays and estuaries, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall issue an order requiring interruption or  
| reduction of the appropriation.  
|  SECTION 62. Section 11.1422(b), Water Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) The executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] or a watermaster  
| who has jurisdiction over the river from which a cemetery diverts  
| water under this section by order may restrict a diversion  
| authorized by this section if the executive _administrator_  
| [ ~~director~~ ] or watermaster determines the diversion will harm a  
| person downstream of the cemetery who acquired a water right before  
| the date this section took effect. The executive _administrator_  
| [ ~~director~~ ] or watermaster shall limit the restriction to the extent  
| of the harm and to the period of the harm.  
|  SECTION 63. Sections 11.143(b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),  
| and (i), Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) If the applicant elects to proceed under this section,

sworn  
| application, on a form furnished by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ],  
| containing the following information:  
|  (1) the name and post-office address of the applicant;  
|  (2) the nature and purpose of the use and the amount of  
| water to be used annually for each purpose;  
|  (3) the major watershed and the tributary (named or  
| unnamed) on which the dam or reservoir is located;  
|  (4) the county in which the dam or reservoir is  
| located;  
|  (5) the approximate distance and direction from the  
| county seat of the county to the location of the dam or reservoir;  
|  (6) the survey or the portion of the survey on which  
| the dam or reservoir is located and, to the best of the applicant's  
| knowledge and belief, the distance and direction of the midpoint of  
| the dam or reservoir from a corner of the survey, which information  
| the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] may require to be marked on  
| an aerial photograph or map furnished by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ];  
|  (7) the approximate surface area, to the nearest acre,  
| of the reservoir when it is full and the average depth in feet when  
| it is full; and  
|  (8) the approximate number of square miles in the  
| drainage area above the dam or reservoir.  
|  (d) Except as otherwise specifically provided by this  
| subsection, before the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may approve the  
| application and issue the permit, it shall give notice and hold a  
| hearing as prescribed by this section. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may  
| act on the application without holding a public hearing if:  
|  (1) not less than 30 days before the date of action on  
| the application by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], the applicant has  
| published the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] notice of the application at  
| least once in a newspaper regularly published or circulated within  
| the section of the state where the source of water is located;  
|  (2) not less than 30 days before the date of action on  
| the application by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], the _board_ [
~~commission~~ ]  
| mails a copy of the notice by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to  
| each person whose claim or appropriation has been filed with the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] and whose diversion point is downstream from  
| that described in the application; and  
|  (3) within 30 days after the date of the newspaper  
| publication of the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] notice, a public hearing  
| is not requested in writing by a _board member_ [ ~~commissioner~~ ], the  
| executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ], or an affected person who  
| objects to the application.  
|  (e) In the notice, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall:  
|  (1) state the name and post-office address of the  
| applicant;  
|  (2) state the date the application was filed;  
|  (3) state the purpose and extent of the proposed  
| appropriation of water;  
|  (4) identify the source of supply, including any  
| proposed alternative source of water, other than state water,  
| identified by the applicant, and the place where the water is  
| stored; and  
|  (5) specify the time and place of the hearing.  
|  (f) The notice shall be published only once, at least 20  
| days before the date stated in the notice for the hearing on the  
| application, in a newspaper having general circulation in the  
| county where the dam or reservoir is located. At least 15 days  
| before the date set for the hearing, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall  
| transmit a copy of the notice by first-class mail to each person  
| whose claim or appropriation has been filed with the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] and whose diversion point is downstream from that  
| described in the application.  If the notice identifies groundwater  
| from a well located in a groundwater conservation district as a  
| proposed alternative source of water, the notice shall be:  
|  (1) sent to the groundwater conservation district in  
| which the well is located; and  
|  (2) published, at least 20 days before the date stated  
| in the notice for the hearing, in a newspaper having general  
| circulation in each county in which the groundwater district is  
| located.  
|  (g) If on the date specified in the notice prescribed by  
| Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ], the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]
determines  
| that a public hearing must be held, the matter shall be remanded for  
| hearing without the necessity of issuing further notice other than  
| advising all parties of the time and place where the hearing is to  
| convene.  
|  (h) The applicant shall pay the filing fee prescribed by

|  SECTION 64. Section 11.144, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.144. APPROVAL FOR ALTERATIONS. All holders of  
| permits and certified filings shall obtain the approval of the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] before making any alterations, enlargements,  
| extensions, or other changes to any reservoir, dam, main canal, or  
| diversion work on which a permit has been granted or a certified  
| filing recorded. A detailed statement and plans for alterations or  
| changes shall be filed with the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] and approved by  
| the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] before the alterations or  
| changes are made. This section does not apply to the ordinary  
| maintenance or emergency repair of the facility.  
|  SECTION 65. Section 11.145, Water Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.145. WHEN CONSTRUCTION MUST BEGIN. (a) If a permit  
| is for appropriation by direct diversion, construction of the  
| proposed facilities shall begin within the time fixed by the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ], which shall not exceed two years after the date the  
| permit is issued. The appropriator shall work diligently and  
| continuously to the completion of the construction. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may, by entering an order of record, extend the time  
| for beginning construction. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may establish  
| fees, not to exceed $1,000, for extending the time to begin  
| construction of the proposed facilities.  
|  (b) If the permit contemplates construction of a storage  
| reservoir, construction shall begin within the time fixed by the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], not to exceed two years after the date the  
| permit is issued. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], by entering an order of  
| record, may extend the time for beginning construction. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may fix fees, not to exceed $1,000, for extending the  
| time to begin construction of reservoirs.  
|  SECTION 66. Sections 11.146(c) and (d), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) If the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] believes that an  
| appropriation or permit should be declared forfeited under this  
| section or any other sections of this code, it should give the  
| appropriator or permittee 30 days notice and provide _the_  
| _appropriator or permittee_ [ ~~him~~ ] with an opportunity to be heard.  
|  (d) After the hearing, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] by entering an  
| order of record may cancel the appropriation in whole or part. The  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall immediately transmit a certified copy of  
| the cancellation order by certified mail to the county clerk of the  
| county in which the permit is recorded. The county clerk shall  
| record the cancellation order.  
|  SECTION 67. Sections 11.147(b), (c), (d), (e), (e-1),  
| (e-3), (f), and (g), Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) In its consideration of an application for a permit to  
| store, take, or divert water, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall assess  
| the effects, if any, of the issuance of the permit on the bays and  
| estuaries of Texas. For permits issued within an area that is 200  
| river miles of the coast, to commence from the mouth of the river  
| thence inland, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall include in the permit  
| any conditions considered necessary to maintain beneficial inflows  
| to any affected bay and estuary system, to the extent practicable  
| when considering all public interests and the studies mandated by  
| Section 16.058 as evaluated under Section 11.1491.  
|  (c) For the purposes of making a determination under  
| Subsection (b) [ ~~of this section~~ ], the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall  
| consider among other factors:  
|  (1) the need for periodic freshwater inflows to supply  
| nutrients and modify salinity to preserve the sound environment of  
| the bay or estuary, using any available information, including  
| studies and plans specified in Section 11.1491 [ ~~of this code~~ ] and  
| other studies considered by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] to be reliable;  
| together with existing circumstances, natural or otherwise, that  
| might prevent the conditions imposed from producing benefits;  
|  (2) the ecology and productivity of the affected bay  
| and estuary system;  
|  (3) the expected effects on the public welfare of not  
| including in the permit some or all of the conditions considered  
| necessary to maintain the beneficial inflows to the affected bay or  
| estuary system;  
|  (4) the quantity of water requested and the proposed  
| use of water by the applicant, as well as the needs of those who  
| would be served by the applicant;  
|  (5) the expected effects on the public welfare of the  
| failure to issue all or part of the permit being considered; and  
|  (6) for purposes of this section, the declarations as  
| to preferences for competing uses of water as found in Sections  
| 11.024 and 11.033, [ ~~Water Code,~~ ] as well as the public policy  
| statement in Section 1.003[ ~~, Water Code~~ ].  
|  (d) In its consideration of an application to store, take,  
| or divert water, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall include in the  
| permit, to the extent practicable when considering all public  
| interests, those conditions considered by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| necessary to maintain existing instream uses and water quality of  
| the stream or river to which the application applies. In  
| determining what conditions to include in the permit under this  
| subsection, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider among other  
| factors:  
|  (1) the studies mandated by Section 16.059; and  
|  (2) any water quality assessment performed under  
| Section 11.150.  
|  (e) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall include in the permit, to  
| the extent practicable when considering all public interests, those  
| conditions considered by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] necessary to  
| maintain fish and wildlife habitats. In determining what  
| conditions to include in the permit under this subsection, the  
| _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider any assessment performed under  
| Section 11.152.  
|  (e-1) Any permit for a new appropriation of water or an  
| amendment to an existing water right that increases the amount of  
| water authorized to be stored, taken, or diverted must include a  
| provision allowing the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] to adjust the conditions  
| included in the permit or amended water right to provide for  
| protection of instream flows or freshwater inflows. With respect  
| to an amended water right, the provision may not allow the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] to adjust a condition of the amendment other than a  
| condition that applies only to the increase in the amount of water  
| to be stored, taken, or diverted authorized by the amendment. This  
| subsection does not affect an appropriation of or an authorization  
| to store, take, or divert water under a permit or amendment to a  
| water right issued before September 1, 2007. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall adjust the conditions if the _board_ [
~~commission~~ ]  
| determines, through an expedited public comment process, that such  
| an adjustment is appropriate to achieve compliance with applicable  
| environmental flow standards adopted under Section 11.1471. The  
| adjustment:  
|  (1) in combination with any previous adjustments made  
| under this subsection may not increase the amount of the  
| pass-through or release requirement for the protection of instream  
| flows or freshwater inflows by more than 12.5 percent of the  
| annualized total of that requirement contained in the permit as  
| issued or of that requirement contained in the amended water right  
| and applicable only to the increase in the amount of water  
| authorized to be stored, taken, or diverted under the amended water  
| right;  
|  (2) must be based on appropriate consideration of the  
| priority dates and diversion locations of any other water rights  
| granted in the same river basin that are subject to adjustment under  
| this subsection; and  
|  (3) must be based on appropriate consideration of any  
| voluntary contributions to the Texas Water Trust, and of any  
| voluntary amendments to existing water rights to change the use of a  
| specified quantity of water to or add a use of a specified quantity  
| of water for instream flows dedicated to environmental needs or bay  
| and estuary inflows as authorized by Section 11.0237(a), that  
| actually contribute toward meeting the applicable environmental  
| flow standards.  
|  (e-3) Notwithstanding Subsections (b)-(e), for the purpose  
| of determining the environmental flow conditions necessary to  
| maintain freshwater inflows to an affected bay and estuary system,  
| existing instream uses and water quality of a stream or river, or  
| fish and aquatic wildlife habitats, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall  
| apply any applicable environmental flow standard, including any  
| environmental flow set-aside, adopted under Section 11.1471  
| instead of considering the factors specified by those subsections.  
|  (f) On receipt of an application for a permit to store,  
| take, or divert water, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall send a copy of  
| the permit application and any subsequent amendments to the Parks  
| and Wildlife Department. At its option, the Parks and Wildlife  
| Department may be a party in hearings on applications for permits to  
| store, take, or divert water. In making a final decision on any  
| application for a permit, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ], in addition to  
| other information, evidence, and testimony presented, shall  
| consider all information, evidence, and testimony presented by the  
| Parks and Wildlife Department [ ~~and the board~~ ].  
|  (g) The failure of the Parks and Wildlife Department to  
| appear as a party does not relieve the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] of the  
| requirements of this section.  
|  SECTION 68. Sections 11.1471(a), (b), (d), (e), and (f),  
| Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] by rule shall:  
|  (1) adopt appropriate environmental flow standards  
| for each river basin and bay system in this state that are adequate  
| to support a sound ecological environment, to the maximum extent  
| reasonable considering other public interests and other relevant  
| factors;  
|  (2) establish an amount of unappropriated water, if  
| available, to be set aside to satisfy the environmental flow  
| standards to the maximum extent reasonable when considering human  
| water needs; and  
|  (3) establish procedures for implementing an  
| adjustment of the conditions included in a permit or an amended  
| water right as provided by Sections 11.147(e-1) and (e-2).  
|  (b) In adopting environmental flow standards for a river  
| basin and bay system under Subsection (a)(1), the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider:  
|  (1) the definition of the geographical extent of the  
| river basin and bay system adopted by the advisory group under  
| Section 11.02362(a) and the definition and designation of the river  
| basin by the board under Section 16.051(c);  
|  (2) the schedule established by the advisory group  
| under Section 11.02362(d) or (e) for the adoption of environmental  
| flow standards for the river basin and bay system, if applicable;  
|  (3) the environmental flow analyses and the  
| recommended environmental flow regime developed by the applicable  
| basin and bay expert science team under Section 11.02362(m);  
|  (4) the recommendations developed by the applicable  
| basin and bay area stakeholders committee under Section 11.02362(o)  
| regarding environmental flow standards and strategies to meet the  
| flow standards;  
|  (5) any comments submitted by the advisory group to  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under Section 11.02362(q);  
|  (6) the specific characteristics of the river basin  
| and bay system;  
|  (7) economic factors;  
|  (8) the human and other competing water needs in the  
| river basin and bay system;  
|  (9) all reasonably available scientific information,  
| including any scientific information provided by the science  
| advisory committee; and  
|  (10) any other appropriate information.  
|  (d) As provided by Section 11.023, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| may not issue a permit for a new appropriation or an amendment to an  
| existing water right that increases the amount of water authorized  
| to be stored, taken, or diverted if the issuance of the permit or  
| amendment would impair an environmental flow set-aside established  
| under Subsection (a)(2). A permit for a new appropriation or an  
| amendment to an existing water right that increases the amount of  
| water authorized to be stored, taken, or diverted that is issued  
| after the adoption of an applicable environmental flow set-aside  
| must contain appropriate conditions to ensure protection of the  
| environmental flow set-aside.  
|  (e) An environmental flow set-aside established under  
| Subsection (a)(2) for a river basin and bay system other than the  
| middle and lower Rio Grande must be assigned a priority date  
| corresponding to the date the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] receives  
| environmental flow regime recommendations from the applicable  
| basin and bay expert science team and be included in the appropriate  
| water availability models in connection with an application for a  
| permit for a new appropriation or for an amendment to an existing  
| water right that increases the amount of water authorized to be  
| stored, taken, or diverted.  
|  (f) An environmental flow standard or environmental flow  
| set-aside adopted under Subsection (a) may be altered by the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] in a rulemaking process undertaken in accordance with  
| a schedule established by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]. In establishing  
| a schedule, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider the applicable  
| work plan approved by the advisory group under Section 11.02362(p).  
| The _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] schedule may not provide for the  
| rulemaking process to occur more frequently than once every 10  
| years unless the work plan provides for a periodic review under  
| Section 11.02362(p) to occur more frequently than once every 10  
| years. In that event, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may provide for the  
| rulemaking process to be undertaken in conjunction with the  
| periodic review if the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] determines that schedule  
| to be appropriate. A rulemaking process undertaken under this  
| subsection must provide for the participation of stakeholders  
| having interests in the particular river basin and bay system for  
| which the process is undertaken.

| [ ~~commission~~ ] to meet the needs for freshwater inflows to affected  
| bays and estuaries and instream uses under Section 11.1471(a)(2)  
| may be made available temporarily for other essential beneficial  
| uses if the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] finds that an emergency exists that  
| cannot practically be resolved in another way.  
|  (b) Before the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] suspends a permit  
| condition under Subsection (a) or makes water available temporarily  
| under Subsection (a-1), it must give written notice to the Parks and  
| Wildlife Department of the proposed action. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| shall give the Parks and Wildlife Department an opportunity to  
| submit comments on the proposed action within 72 hours from such  
| time and the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider those comments  
| before issuing its order implementing the proposed action.  
|  (c) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may suspend the permit condition  
| under Subsection (a) or make water available temporarily under  
| Subsection (a-1) without notice to any other interested party other

| provided by this section. The watermaster's duties shall include  
| activities that relate to situations of imminent threat to public  
| health and safety or the environment. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall  
| adopt rules:  
|  (1) defining situations of imminent threat under this  
| section; and  
|  (2) addressing the watermaster's duties in response to  
| terrorism.  
|  (f) The watermaster may store in a reservoir for release at  
| a later time water in transit that is being conveyed down the banks  
| and bed of the Rio Grande under a permit issued by the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] and in accordance with rules prescribed by the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ]. In this section, "water in transit" means privately  
| owned water, not including state water, that a person has pumped  
| from an underground reservoir and that is in transit between the  
| point of discharge into the river and the place of use or the point  
| of diversion by a person who has contracted with the owner of the  
| water to purchase the water. The contract must specify that the  
| contract is for the purchase and delivery of a specified amount of  
| water less the carriage losses incurred in transit, as described  
| and measured according to _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] rules.  
|  (g) The watermaster may store water under Subsection (f)  
| only if the storage does not hinder the ability of any other holders  
| of Rio Grande surface water rights to store the maximum authorized  
| capacity in a reservoir as specified by _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] rules  
| and relevant permits, certified filings, or certificates of  
| adjudication.  
|  (h) Before granting a permit to convey water down the banks  
| and bed of the Rio Grande, the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall adopt rules  
| that provide for the methods and procedures by which the  
| watermaster shall account for any discharge, delivery, conveyance,  
| storage, diversion, or associated loss of water conveyed down the  
| banks and bed of the Rio Grande. A permit to convey water down the  
| banks and bed of the Rio Grande may not allow the permit holder to  
| share in any beneficial state water inflows into the Rio Grande.  
| The permit holder is entitled to convey only the amount of water  
| specified in the permit, less the carriage losses incurred in  
| transit, as described and measured according to _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| rules. A rule adopted by the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] under this  
| subsection must be consistent with the Treaty Relating to the  
| Utilization of the Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers, and of  
| the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo) from Fort Quitman, Texas, to the Gulf of  
| Mexico, concluded by the United States and the United Mexican  
| States on February 3, 1944, and with any minute order adopted by the  
| International Boundary and Water Commission.  
|  (i) In considering an application for a permit to convey  
| water down the banks and bed of the Rio Grande, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall consider the quality of the water to be  
| conveyed. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may not issue a permit if it  
| determines that the water to be conveyed would degrade the water  
| quality of the Rio Grande.  
|  SECTION 92. Section 11.3271(j), Water Code, as added by  
| Chapter 385 (S.B. 1902), Acts of the 78th Legislature, Regular  
| Session, 2003, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (j) Notwithstanding any other law, the watermaster is the  
| official recorder for all instruments, including deeds, deeds of  
| trust, financing statements, security agreements, and liens, that  
| the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] authorizes or requires to be filed in  
| connection with water rights relating to water in the lower,  
| middle, or upper basin of the Rio Grande that are subject to a  
| permit, certified filing, or certificate of adjudication. An  
| instrument shall be filed with the watermaster under this  
| subsection in the same manner as required by other law for the same  
| type of instrument. The filing of an instrument under this  
| subsection results in the same legal and administrative status and  
| consequences as a filing under other law for the same type of  
| instrument. An instrument filed under this subsection shall be  
| construed by a court, financial institution, or other affected  
| person in the same manner as an instrument of the same type that is  
| filed under other law. The watermaster may charge and collect a fee  
| for the recordation of instruments under this subsection in the  
| same amount as the fee collected by the county clerk of Cameron  
| County for the recordation of similar instruments. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] by rule shall prescribe the procedures necessary for  
| the proper implementation of this subsection, including reasonable  
| transition provisions, if appropriate.

| necessary expenses of a watermaster, assistant watermasters, and  
| other necessary employees, but the holders of water rights that  
| have been determined or adjudicated and are to be administered by  
| the watermaster shall reimburse the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] for the  
| compensation and expenses. Necessary expenses shall be limited to  
| costs associated with streamflow measurement and monitoring, water  
| accounting, assessment billing and collection associated with a  
| watermaster's operation, and other duties a watermaster may be  
| required to perform under this subchapter.  
|  (b) After the adjudication decree becomes final, and each  
| fiscal year thereafter, the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ]  
| shall provide notice to each holder of water rights under the  
| decree, at least 30 days prior to the _board's_ [ ~~commission's~~ ] holding  
| a public hearing as provided in Subsection (c), of the proposed  
| budget for their watermaster operations showing the amount of  
| compensation and expenses that will be required annually for the  
| administration of the water rights so determined. This budget  
| shall be furnished to the watermaster advisory committee for  
| comment at least 30 days prior to notification to each holder of  
| water rights.  
|  (c) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall hold a public hearing on  
| the proposed fiscal year budget for each watermaster operation.  
| The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall determine the apportionment of the  
| costs of administration of adjudicated water rights among the  
| holders of the rights. After a public hearing, the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] shall issue an order assessing the annual cost against  
| the holders of water rights to whom the water will be distributed  
| under the final decree. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall equitably  
| apportion the costs. The executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] may  
| provide for payments in installments and shall specify the dates by  
| which payments shall be made to the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ]. At the  
| request of the watermaster advisory committee the _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may modify a fiscal year budget for any water  
| division.  
|  (f) An order of the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] assessing costs  
| remains in effect until the _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] issues a further  
| order. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may modify, revoke, or supersede an  
| order assessing costs with a subsequent order. The _board_  
| [ ~~commission~~ ] may issue supplementary orders from time to time to  
| apply to new diversions.  
|  (g) The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] may not assess costs under this  
| section against a holder of a non-priority hydroelectric right that  
| owns or operates privately owned facilities that collectively have  
| a capacity of less than two megawatts or against a holder of a water  
| right placed in the Texas Water Trust for a term of at least 20  
| years.

|  (b) The legislature hereby appropriates without further  
| legislative action any funds deposited in the _watermaster_  
| [ ~~watermaster's~~ ] fund as provided in this subchapter. The  
| watermaster fund shall be used:  
|  (1) to pay the compensation and expenses of the  
| watermaster in each water division;  
|  (2) to pay expenditures for equipment, facilities, and  
| capital expenditures necessary to the watermaster operation when  
| recommended by the watermaster advisory committee and the executive

~~commission~~ ]  
| when hearings are required as provided in Section 11.329; and

| discharge pipe of a pumping plant, constructed so that it can be  
| locked at the proper place by the watermaster, or a suitable outlet  
| in a dam to allow the free passage of water that the owner of the dam  
| is not entitled to divert or impound. The _board_ [ ~~commission~~ ] shall  
| adopt rules, and the executive _administrator_ [ ~~director~~ ] shall  
| enforce the rules, governing the type and location of the headgates

| [ ~~by the district~~ ] under Section 36.108.  
|  (b) The management plan, or any amendments to the plan,  
| shall be developed using the _groundwater management authority's_  
| [ ~~district's~~ ] best available data and forwarded to the regional  
| water planning group for use in their planning process.  
|  (c) The commission and the Texas Water Development Board  
| shall provide technical assistance [ ~~to a district~~ ] in the  
| development of the management plan required under Subsection (a)  
| which may include, if requested by the _groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~district~~ ], a preliminary review and comment on the plan  
| prior to final approval by the _groundwater management authority_  
| [ ~~board~~ ]. If such review and comment by the commission is requested,  
| the commission shall provide comment not later than 30 days from the  
| date the request is received.  
|  (d) The commission _and the Texas Water Development Board_  
| shall provide technical assistance to a district _or groundwater_  
| _management authority_ during its initial operational phase. If  
| requested by a district _or a groundwater management authority_ , the  
| Texas Water Development Board shall _provide training_ [ ~~train the~~  
|  ~~district~~ ] on basic data collection methodology and provide  
| technical assistance [ ~~to districts~~ ].  
|  (e) In the management plan described under Subsection (a),  
| the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall:

| bodies, including lakes, streams, and rivers;  
|  (E) the annual volume of flow into and out of the  
| _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] within each aquifer  
| and between aquifers in the _groundwater management authority_  
| [ ~~district~~ ], if a groundwater availability model is available;  
|  (F) the projected surface water supply in the  
| _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] according to the most  
| recently adopted state water plan _or water availability model_ ;  
| [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (G) the projected total demand for water in the  
| _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] according to the most  
| recently adopted state water plan; and  
|  _(H)_ _____the minimum amount of groundwater necessary_  
| _to sustain six months of domestic and livestock use during the most_  
| _recent drought of record; and_  
|  (4) consider the water supply needs and water  
| management strategies included in the adopted state water plan.  
|  (f) The _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall  
| adopt rules necessary to implement the management plan. Prior to  
| the development of the management plan and its approval under  
| Section 36.1072, the _groundwater management authority or_ district  
| may not adopt rules other than rules pertaining to the registration  
| and interim permitting of new and existing wells and rules  
| governing spacing and procedure before the _groundwater management_  
| _authority's or_ district's board; however, the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] may not adopt any rules limiting  
| the production of wells, except rules requiring that groundwater  
| produced from a well be put to a nonwasteful, beneficial use. The  
| district _or groundwater management authority_ may accept  
| applications for permits under Section 36.113, provided the  
| district _or groundwater management authority_ does not act on any  
| such application until the _groundwater management authority's_  
| [ ~~district's~~ ] management plan is approved as provided in Section  
| 36.1072.  
|  (g) The _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall  
| adopt amendments to the management plan as necessary. Amendments  
| to the management plan shall be adopted after notice and hearing and  
| shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.  
|  (h) In developing its management plan, the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall use the groundwater  
| availability modeling information provided by the executive  
| administrator together with any available site-specific  
| information that has been provided by the district _or groundwater_  
| _management authority_ to the executive administrator for review and  
| comment before being used in the plan.  
|  _(i)_ _____The data determined in this section and placed in the_  
| _final groundwater management plan is not subject to challenge in_  
| _court in any collateral legal action._  
|  SECTION 162. Sections 36.1072(a-1), (b), (c), (e), (f), and  
| (g), Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a-1) A _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall,  
| not later than _September 1, 2022_ [ ~~three years after the creation of~~  
|  ~~the district or, if the district required confirmation, not later~~  
|  ~~than three years after the election confirming the district's~~  
|  ~~creation~~ ], submit the management plan required under Section  
| 36.1071 to the executive administrator for review and approval.  
|  (b) Within 60 days of receipt of a [ ~~district's~~ ] management  
| plan adopted under Section 36.1071, readopted under Subsection (e)  
| or (g) [ ~~of this section~~ ], or amended under Section 36.1073, the  
| executive administrator shall approve the [ ~~district's~~ ] plan if the  
| plan is administratively complete. A management plan is  
| administratively complete when it contains the information  
| required to be submitted under Section 36.1071(a) and (e).  The  
| executive administrator may determine whether conditions justify  
| waiver of the requirements under Section 36.1071(e)(4).  
|  (c) Once the executive administrator has approved a  
| [ ~~district's~~ ] management plan:  
|  (1) the executive administrator may not revoke but may  
| require revisions to the approved management plan as provided by  
| Subsection (g); and  
|  (2) the executive administrator may request  
| additional information from the _groundwater management authority_  
| [ ~~district~~ ] if the information is necessary to clarify, modify, or  
| supplement previously submitted material, but a request for  
| additional information does not render the management plan  
| unapproved.  
|  (e) The _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] may  
| review the plan annually and must review and readopt the plan with  
| or without revisions at least once every five years. The  
| _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall provide the  
| readopted plan to the executive administrator not later than the  
| 60th day after the date on which the plan was readopted. Approval  
| of the preceding management plan remains in effect until:  
|  (1) the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ]  
| fails to timely readopt a management plan;  
|  (2) the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ]  
| fails to timely submit the _groundwater management authority's_  
| [ ~~district's~~ ] readopted management plan to the executive  
| administrator; or  
|  (3) the executive administrator determines that the  
| readopted management plan does not meet the requirements for  
| approval, and the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] has  
| exhausted all appeals to the Texas Water Development Board [ ~~or~~  
|  ~~appropriate court~~ ].  
|  (f) If the executive administrator does not approve the  
| _groundwater management authority's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] management plan,  
| the executive administrator shall provide to the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ], in writing, the reasons for the  
| action. Not later than the 180th day after the date a _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] receives notice that its  
| management plan has not been approved, the _groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] may submit a revised management plan for  
| review and approval. The executive administrator's decision may be  
| appealed to the development board. [ ~~If the development board~~  
|  ~~decides not to approve the district's management plan on appeal,~~  
|  ~~the district may request that the conflict be mediated. The~~  
|  ~~district and the board may seek the assistance of the Center for~~  
|  ~~Public Policy Dispute Resolution at The University of Texas School~~  
|  ~~of Law or an alternative dispute resolution system established~~  
|  ~~under Chapter 152, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, in obtaining a~~  
|  ~~qualified impartial third party to mediate the conflict. The cost~~  
|  ~~of the mediation services must be specified in the agreement~~  
|  ~~between the parties and the Center for Public Policy Dispute~~  
|  ~~Resolution or the alternative dispute resolution system. If the~~  
|  ~~parties do not resolve the conflict through mediation, the decision~~  
|  ~~of the development board not to approve the district's management~~  
|  ~~plan may be appealed to a district court in Travis County. Costs~~  
|  ~~for the appeal shall be set by the court hearing the appeal. An~~  
|  ~~appeal under this subsection is by trial de novo. The commission~~  
|  ~~shall not take enforcement action against a district under~~  
|  ~~Subchapter I until the latest of the expiration of the 180-day~~  
|  ~~period, the date the development board has taken final action~~  
|  ~~withholding approval of a revised management plan, the date the~~  
|  ~~mediation is completed, or the date a final judgment upholding the~~  
|  ~~board's decision is entered by a district court. An enforcement~~  
|  ~~action may not be taken against a district by the commission or the~~  
|  ~~state auditor under Subchapter I because the district's management~~  
|  ~~plan and the approved regional water plan are in conflict while the~~  
|  ~~parties are attempting to resolve the conflict before the~~  
|  ~~development board, in mediation, or in court. Rules of the district~~  
|  ~~continue in full force and effect until all appeals under this~~  
|  ~~subsection have been exhausted and the final judgment is adverse to~~  
|  ~~the district.~~ ]  
|  (g) A person with a legally defined interest in groundwater  
| in a _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ], or the regional  
| water planning group, may file a petition with the development  
| board stating that a conflict requiring resolution may exist  
| between the _authority's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] approved management plan  
| developed under Section 36.1071 and the state water plan. If a  
| conflict exists, the development board shall provide technical  
| assistance to and facilitate coordination between the involved  
| person or regional water planning group and the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] to resolve the conflict. Not later  
| than the 45th day after the date the person or the regional water  
| planning group files a petition with the development board, if the  
| conflict has not been resolved, the _groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] and the involved person or regional planning  
| group may _petition the executive administrator to resolve_ [ ~~mediate~~ ]  
| the conflict. The [ ~~district and the involved person or regional~~  
|  ~~planning group may seek the assistance of the Center for Public~~  
|  ~~Policy Dispute Resolution at The University of Texas School of Law~~  
|  ~~or an alternative dispute resolution system established under~~  
|  ~~Chapter 152, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, in obtaining a~~  
|  ~~qualified impartial third party to mediate the conflict. The cost~~  
|  ~~of the mediation services must be specified in the agreement~~  
|  ~~between the parties and the Center for Public Policy Dispute~~  
|  ~~Resolution or the alternative dispute resolution system. If the~~  
|  ~~district and the involved person or regional planning group cannot~~  
|  ~~resolve the conflict through mediation, the~~ ] development board  
| shall resolve the conflict not later than the 60th day after the  
| date the _petition is received_ [ ~~mediation is completed~~ ]. The  
| development board action under this provision may be consolidated,  
| at the option of the _development_ board, with related action under  
| Section 16.053(p). If the development board determines that  
| resolution of the conflict requires a revision of the approved  
| management plan, the development board shall provide information to  
| the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ]. The _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall prepare any revisions to the  
| plan based on the information provided by the development board and  
| shall hold, after notice, at least one public hearing at some  
| central location within the _groundwater management authority_  
| [ ~~district~~ ]. The _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ]
shall  
| consider all public and development board comments, prepare,  
| revise, and adopt its management plan, and submit the revised  
| management plan to the development board for approval. On the  
| request of the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] or the  
| regional water planning group, the development board shall include  
| discussion of the conflict and its resolution in the state water  
| plan that the development board provides to the governor, the  
| lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the house of  
| representatives under Section 16.051(e). [ ~~If the groundwater~~  
|  ~~conservation district disagrees with the decision of the~~

|  ~~the decision to a district court in Travis County. Costs for the~~  
|  ~~appeal shall be set by the court hearing the appeal. An appeal~~  
|  ~~under this subsection is by trial de novo.~~ ]

| boundaries of the same _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ],  
| each district shall _cooperate with and provide any data requested_  
| _by the groundwater management authority, and the authority shall_  
| _consider the input and recommendations from each district in_  
| _developing its management plan_ [ ~~forward a copy of that district's~~  
|  ~~new or revised management plan to the other districts in the~~  
|  ~~management area. The boards of the districts shall consider the~~  
|  ~~plans individually and shall compare them to other management plans~~  
|  ~~then in force in the management area~~ ].  
|  (c) The district representatives shall meet at least  
| annually to conduct joint planning with the _groundwater management_  
| _authority in which the districts are located_ [ ~~other districts in~~  
|  ~~the management area~~ ] and to review the management plans, the  
| accomplishments of the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ],  
| and proposals to adopt new or amend existing desired future  
| conditions. In reviewing the management plans, the districts _and_  
| _groundwater management authority_ shall consider:  
|  (1) the goals of _the_ [ ~~each~~ ] management plan and its  
| impact on planning throughout the _groundwater_ management _authority_  
| [ ~~area~~ ];  
|  (2) the effectiveness of the measures established by  
| _the_ [ ~~each district's~~ ] management plan for conserving and protecting  
| groundwater and preventing waste, and the effectiveness of these  
| measures in the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ] generally;  
|  (3) any other matters that the boards _of the districts_  
| _and the groundwater management authority_ consider relevant to the  
| protection and conservation of groundwater and the prevention of  
| waste in the _groundwater_ management _authority_ area; and  
|  (4) the degree to which each management plan achieves  
| the desired future conditions established during the joint planning  
| process.  
|  (d) Not later than May 1, 2021, and every five years  
| thereafter, the districts _and groundwater management authority_  
| shall consider groundwater availability models and other data or  
| information for the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ] and  
| shall propose for adoption desired future conditions for the  
| relevant aquifers within the _groundwater_ management _authority_  
| [ ~~area~~ ]. Before voting on the proposed desired future conditions of  
| the aquifers under Subsection _(d-3)_ [ ~~(d-2)~~ ], the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~districts~~ ] shall consider:  
|  (1) aquifer uses or conditions within the _groundwater_  
| management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ], including conditions that differ  
| substantially from one geographic area to another;  
|  (2) the water supply needs and water management  
| strategies included in the state water plan;  
|  (3) hydrological conditions, including for each  
| aquifer in the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ] the total  
| estimated recoverable storage as provided by the executive  
| administrator, and the average annual recharge, inflows, and  
| discharge;  
|  (4) other environmental impacts, including impacts on  
| spring flow and other interactions between groundwater and surface  
| water;  
|  (5) the impact on subsidence;  
|  (6) socioeconomic impacts reasonably expected to  
| occur;  
|  (7) the impact on the interests and rights in private  
| property, including ownership and the rights of _landowners within_  
| _the groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area landowners~~ ] and their  
| lessees and assigns in groundwater as recognized under Section  
| 36.002;  
|  (8) the feasibility of achieving the desired future  
| condition; and  
|  (9) any other information relevant to the specific  
| desired future conditions.  
|  (d-1) After considering and documenting the factors  
| described by Subsection (d) and other relevant scientific and  
| hydrogeological data, the _groundwater management authority, with_  
| _the input and assistance of the_ districts _,_ may establish different  
| desired future conditions for:  
|  (1) each aquifer, subdivision of an aquifer, or  
| geologic strata located in whole or in part within the boundaries of  
| the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ]; or  
|  (2) each geographic area overlying an aquifer in whole  
| or in part or subdivision of an aquifer within the boundaries of the  
| _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ].  
|  (d-2) The desired future conditions proposed under  
| Subsection (d) must provide a balance between the highest  
| practicable level of groundwater production and the conservation,  
| preservation, protection, recharging, and prevention of waste of  
| groundwater and control of subsidence in the _groundwater_ management  
| _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ]. This subsection does not prohibit the  
| establishment of desired future conditions that provide for the  
| reasonable long-term management of groundwater resources  
| consistent with the management goals under Section 36.1071(a).  
| [ ~~The desired future conditions proposed under Subsection (d) must~~  
|  ~~be approved by a two-thirds vote of all the district~~  
|  ~~representatives for distribution to the districts in the management~~  
|  ~~area.~~ ] A period of not less than 90 days for public comments begins  
| on the day the proposed desired future conditions are _adopted by the_  
| _groundwater management authority's board of directors_ [ ~~mailed to~~  
|  ~~the districts~~ ]. During the public comment period and after posting  
| notice as required by Section 36.063, _the groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~each district~~ ] shall hold a public hearing on any  
| proposed desired future conditions [ ~~relevant to that district~~ ].  
| During the public comment period, the _groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall make available in its office a copy of  
| the proposed desired future conditions and any supporting  
| materials, such as the documentation of factors considered under  
| Subsection (d) and groundwater availability model run results.  
| After the close of the public comment period, the _groundwater_  
| _management authority_ [ ~~district~~ ] shall compile for consideration at  
| the next _groundwater management authority board_ [ ~~joint planning~~ ]  
| meeting _, and shall provide a copy to each district within its_  
| _boundaries,_ a summary of relevant comments received, any suggested  
| revisions to the proposed desired future conditions, and the basis  
| for the revisions. _Not later than the 30th day after the date the_  
| _groundwater management authority sends the documents described by_  
| _this subsection to the districts, the districts shall provide_  
| _written comments to the groundwater management authority._  
|  (d-3) After all the districts have submitted their _comments_  
| [ ~~district summaries~~ ], the _groundwater management authority board_  
| [ ~~district representatives~~ ] shall _:_  
|  _(1) meet_ [ ~~reconvene~~ ] to review the reports, consider  
| any district's suggested revisions to the proposed desired future  
| conditions, and finally adopt the desired future conditions for the  
| _groundwater_ management _authority; and_  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~area.~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~The desired future conditions must be~~  
|  ~~approved by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of all the~~  
|  ~~district representatives not later than January 5,~~  
|  ~~2022.~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~Subsequent desired future conditions must be proposed
and~~  
|  ~~finally adopted by the district representatives before the end of~~  
|  ~~each successive five-year period after that date.~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~The
district~~  
|  ~~representatives shall~~ ] produce a desired future conditions  
| explanatory report for the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ]  
| and submit to the development board [ ~~and each district in the~~  
|  ~~management area proof that notice was posted for the joint planning~~  
|  ~~meeting,~~ ] a copy of the resolution[ ~~,~~ ] and a copy of the
explanatory  
| report _, which_ [ ~~. The report~~] must:  
|  _(A)_ [ ~~(1)~~ ] identify each desired future  
| condition;  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~(2)~~ ] provide the policy and technical  
| justifications for each desired future condition;  
|  _(C)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] include documentation that the factors  
| under Subsection (d) were considered by the _groundwater management_  
| _authority_ [ ~~districts~~ ] and a discussion of how the adopted desired  
| future conditions impact each factor;  
|  _(D)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] list other desired future condition  
| options considered, if any, and the reasons why those options were  
| not adopted; and  
|  _(E)_ [ ~~(5)~~ ] discuss reasons why recommendations  
| made by advisory committees and relevant public comments received  
| by the _groundwater management authority_ [ ~~districts~~ ] were or were  
| not incorporated into the desired future conditions.  
|  (e) Except as provided by this section, a joint meeting  
| under this section must be held in accordance with Chapter 551,  
| Government Code. Each district shall comply with Chapter 552,  
| Government Code. The district representatives may elect one  
| district to be responsible for providing the notice of a joint  
| meeting that this section would otherwise require of each district  
| in the _groundwater_ management _authority_ [ ~~area~~ ]. Notice of a joint  
| meeting must be provided at least 10 days before the date of the  
| meeting by:  
|  (1) providing notice to the secretary of state;

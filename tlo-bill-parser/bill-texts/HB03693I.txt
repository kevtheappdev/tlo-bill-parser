| _population according to the most recent federal census. The rules_  
| _shall include a procedure for issuance of new package store permits_

| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

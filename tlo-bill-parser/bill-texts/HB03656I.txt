|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relati  
| ng to the transfer of certain permitted irrigation water  
| rights related to a certain portion of the Edwards Aquifer.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 1.34, Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd  
| Legislature, Regular Session, 1993, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 1.34. TRANSFER OF RIGHTS.  (a)  _In this section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Developed" means land that can no longer be used_  
| _for agricultural purposes due to:_  
|  _(B)_ _____actual construction upon and physical_  
| _alteration of historically irrigated land caused by the_  
| _construction of roads, parking lots, driveways, foundations,_  
| _structures, buildings, stormwater collection systems, public_  
| _parks, athletic fields, or similar improvements; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____rezoning by an appropriate authority such_  
| _that it can no longer be used for agricultural purposes and the_  
| _owner of the land no longer seeks to designate the land as_  
| _agricultural use in accordance with Chapter 23, Subchapter C of the_  
| _Tax Code._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Historically irrigated land" means the lands_  
| _irrigated during the historical period, as described by Section_  
| _1.16, that provided the basis for the issuance of an initial regular_  
| _permit for irrigation use and is identified as the place of use in_  
| _the initial regular permit._  
|  _(b)_ Water withdrawn from the aquifer must be used within the  
| boundaries of the authority.  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] The authority by rule may establish a procedure by  
| which a person who installs water conservation equipment may sell  
| the water conserved.  
|  _(d)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] _Except as otherwise provided by this section, a_  
| [ ~~A~~ ] permit holder may lease permitted water rights, but a holder of  
| a permit for irrigation use may not lease more than 50 percent of  
| the irrigation rights initially permitted. The user's remaining  
| irrigation water rights must be used in accordance with the  
| original permit and must pass with transfer of the irrigated land.  
|  _(e)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (f), the owner of the_  
| _irrigated land may sever the remaining water rights for use in_  
| _irrigation if at least 75 percent of the historically irrigated is_  
| _developed. Water rights used for irrigation tied to portions of_  
| _land that cannot be developed due to location within a floodplain or_  
| _are impractical to develop due to shape or topography may be_  
| _included in the proportion of land considered developed. Water_  
| _rights for use in irrigation severed under this subsection may_  
| _change in use, so long as at least 25 percent of the use remains in_  
| _the same county as the original use and consistent with authority_  
| _rules. Rules adopted to implement this subsection may not expand_  
| _the type of land considered developed._  
|  _(f)_ _____The authority may adopt rules to provide for a holder of_  
| _an initial regular permit for use in irrigation to lease the full_  
| _amount of the water rights for use in irrigation granted in the_  
| _initial permit to another person for irrigating land located in the_  
| _authority._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 1.34, Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular Session,  
| 1993, applies only to a transfer, and the contracts or other  
| transaction documents of any kind related thereto, including  
| documents related to the extension of credit, hereinafter  
| collectively referred to as "transfer", effective on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. The change in law made by this Act to  
| Section 1.34, Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular  
| Session, 1993, does not affect the validity of a transfer effective  
| before the effective date of this Act. A transfer effective before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the provisions of  
| Chapter 626, Acts of the 73rd Legislature, Regular Session, 1993,  
| and the rules of the Edwards Aquifer Authority in effect at the time  
| the transfer became effective. Transfers effective before the  
| effective date of this Act, that have not been rescinded, and are  
| not subject to pending litigation are hereby conclusively validated  
| in all respects.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

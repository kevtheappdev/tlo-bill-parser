| follows:  
|  Sec. 2.01. BOARD OF TRUSTEES. A board of trustees of the  
| police pension fund is created, in which is vested the general  
| administration, management, and responsibility for the proper and  
| effective operation of the fund. [ ~~The board shall be organized~~  
|  ~~immediately after the members have qualified and taken the oath of~~  
|  ~~office.~~ ] The board has all necessary powers to discharge the  
| board's duties, including the authority to adopt necessary rules  
| for the administration of the fund and to correct any defect, supply  
| any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency that may appear in  
| this Act in a manner and to the extent that the board considers  
| expedient for the administration of this Act for the greatest  
| benefit of all members of the fund.  
|  Sec. 2.02. COMPOSITION OF BOARD. (a) The board of trustees  
| of the fund is composed of _eight trustees_ [ ~~seven members~~ ] as  
| follows:

|  (b) _To be appointed or elected a trustee under this section,_  
| _a person must have demonstrated financial, accounting, business,_  
| _investment, budgeting, real estate, or actuarial expertise_ [ ~~If the~~

| order under Title 4, Family Code, involving the same parties named  
| in the application. (Code Crim. Proc., Art. 7A.01.)  
|  Art. 7B.002. TEMPORARY EX PARTE ORDER.  If the court finds  
| from the information contained in an application for a protective

| household. (Code Crim. Proc., Art. 7A.02.)  
|  Art. 7B.003. REQUIRED FINDINGS; ISSUANCE OF PROTECTIVE

| 21.11, 22.011, or 22.021, Penal Code, and that describes the  
| offense committed against the child is admissible as evidence in  
| the same manner that a child's statement regarding alleged abuse  
| against the child is admissible under Section 104.006, Family Code,  
| in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship. (Code Crim.  
| Proc., Art. 7A.035.)

| household, including following the person, that is reasonably  
| likely to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass the  
| person; and  
|  (D) possessing a firearm, unless the alleged  
| offender is a peace officer, as defined by Section 1.07, Penal Code,  
| actively engaged in employment as a sworn, full-time paid employee  
| of a state agency or political subdivision.  
|  (b) In a protective order that includes a condition  
| described by Subsection (a)(2)(B), the court shall specifically  
| describe each prohibited location and the minimum distance from the

| of information revealing the locations.

| UNLESS A COURT CHANGES THE ORDER."  
|  "IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON, OTHER THAN A PEACE OFFICER, AS  
| DEFINED BY SECTION 1.07, PENAL CODE, ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EMPLOYMENT  
| AS A SWORN, FULL-TIME PAID EMPLOYEE OF A STATE AGENCY OR POLITICAL

| acting on behalf of a victim who is younger than 17 years of age; or  
|  (2) a victim of an offense listed in Article  
| 7B.001(a)(2) or a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a victim  
| who is younger than 18 years of age.  
|  (c) To the extent of any conflict with Section 85.025,

| under Section 42.072, Penal Code, was committed; and  
|  (2) the nature of the scheme or course of conduct  
| engaged in by the defendant in committing the offense indicates the  
| defendant is likely in the future to engage in conduct prohibited by

|  (H) a contract or self-funded program providing  
| hospital and other health care services or benefits; or  
|  (I) proceeds awarded to the claimant or victim as  
| a result of third-party litigation.

| Section 24.012 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___24.012._ _____EXPUNCTION OF RECORDS IN RESIDENTIAL EVICTION_  
| _SUITS. (a) A court has jurisdiction to order the expunction of_  
| _records related to a residential eviction suit if the suit was filed_  
| _originally or on appeal with the court. The court may, on oral or_  
| _written motion of the tenant in the suit, order all records related_  
| _to the suit in the possession or under the control of the court or_  
| _other person be expunged if the court finds that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the suit is or was without sufficient basis in fact_  
| _or law, including a lack of jurisdiction over the case;_  
|  _(2) the expunction is in the interest of justice; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the interest of justice is not outweighed by the_  
| _public's interest in the records._  
|  _(b)_ _____If the motion for expunction is made at trial, the_  
| _justice court may, concurrently with a decision in the suit, order_  
| _records expunged under this section. An order issued under this_

| _appeal of the decision. On appeal of the suit to county court, an_  
| _order issued under this subsection is void._  
|  _(c)_ _____A person may not publish and shall destroy a record that_  
| _is in the person's possession or under the person's control if the_  
| _person knows that an order of expunction of the record has been_  
| _issued under this section._  
|  _(d)_ _____A person who knowingly violates Subsection (c) is liable_  
| _to an injured party for:_  
|  _(1) actual damages;_  
|  _(2) exemplary damages of $1,000; and_  
|  _(3) reasonable attorney's fees and court costs._  
|  _(e)_ _____Notwithstanding Section 41.004(a), Civil Practice and_  
| _Remedies Code, a court shall award exemplary damages under_  
| _Subsection (d)(2) to the injured party irrespective of whether the_  
| _party is awarded actual damages._  
|  _(f)_ _____The supreme court shall adopt rules necessary to_  
| _implement this section._  
|  SECTION 2. Not later than January 1, 2020, the Texas Supreme  
| Court shall adopt the rules necessary to implement Section 24.012,  
| Property Code, as added by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 24.012, Property Code, as added by this  
| Act, applies to a motion made on or after January 1, 2020, with  
| respect to a residential eviction suit that commences before, on,  
| or after January 1, 2020.

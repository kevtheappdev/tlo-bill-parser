|  AN ACT  
| relating to the treatment of a replacement structure for a  
| structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty  
| or by wind or water damage as a new improvement for ad valorem tax  
| purposes.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.26(o), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (o) Notwithstanding Subsections (a), (a-3), and (b), an  
| improvement to property that would otherwise constitute an  
| improvement under Subsection (b) is not treated as an improvement  
| under that subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure  
| for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a  
| casualty or by wind or water damage. For purposes of appraising  
| the property in the tax year in which the structure would have  
| constituted an improvement under Subsection (b), the replacement  
| structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection  
| only if[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] the square footage of the replacement structure  
| exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed  
| before the casualty or damage occurred[ ~~; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the exterior of the replacement structure is of~~  
|  ~~higher quality construction and composition than that of the~~  
|  ~~replaced structure~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. Section 11.261(m), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (m) Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c), an improvement  
| to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under  
| Subsection (c) is not treated as an improvement under that  
| subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a  
| structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty  
| or by wind or water damage. For purposes of appraising the  
| property in the tax year in which the structure would have  
| constituted an improvement under Subsection (c), the replacement  
| structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection  
| only if[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] the square footage of the replacement structure  
| exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed  
| before the casualty or damage occurred[ ~~; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the exterior of the replacement structure is of~~  
|  ~~higher quality construction and composition than that of the~~  
|  ~~replaced structure~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 23.23(f) and (g), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (f) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (e) and except as  
| provided by Subdivision (2), an improvement to property that would  
| otherwise constitute a new improvement is not treated as a new  
| improvement if the improvement is a replacement structure for a  
| structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty  
| or by wind or water damage. For purposes of appraising the  
| property under Subsection (a) in the tax year in which the structure  
| would have constituted a new improvement:  
|  (1) the appraised value the property would have had in  
| the preceding tax year if the casualty or damage had not occurred is  
| considered to be the appraised value of the property for that year,  
| regardless of whether that appraised value exceeds the actual  
| appraised value of the property for that year as limited by  
| Subsection (a); and  
|  (2) the replacement structure is considered to be a  
| new improvement only if[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(A)~~ ] the square footage of the replacement  
| structure exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure  
| existed before the casualty or damage occurred[ ~~; or~~  
|  [ ~~(B)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the exterior of the replacement structure is~~  
|  ~~of higher quality construction and composition than that of the~~  
|  ~~replaced structure~~ ].  
|  (g) In this subsection, "disaster recovery program" means  
| the disaster recovery program administered by the General Land  
| Office that is funded with community development block grant  
| disaster recovery money authorized by the Consolidated Security,  
| Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (Pub.  
| L. No. 110-329) _,_ and the Consolidated and Further Continuing  
| Appropriations Act, 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-55). Notwithstanding  
| Subsection (f)(2), and only to the extent necessary to satisfy the  
| requirements of the disaster recovery program, a replacement  
| structure described by that subdivision is not considered to be a  
| new improvement if to satisfy the requirements of the disaster  
| recovery program it was necessary that[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] the square footage of the replacement structure  
| exceed that of the replaced structure as that structure existed  
| before the casualty or damage occurred[ ~~; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the exterior of the replacement structure be of~~  
|  ~~higher quality construction and composition than that of the~~  
|  ~~replaced structure~~ ].  
|  SECTION 4. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

| permitted under Section 13.242(c) to provide service without a  
| certificate of public convenience and necessity to request or  
| implement a rate increase and operate according to rules,  
| regulations, and standards of service other than those otherwise  
| required under this chapter provided that rates are just and  
| reasonable for customers and the utility and that service is safe,  
| adequate, efficient, and reasonable.

| _determined by the PUC, to furnish service, instrumentalities, and_  
| _facilities that are safe, adequate, efficient, and reasonable._  
|  _(2)_ _____The commission shall use the proceeds of the bond to_  
| _make any necessary improvements to the bring the water or sewer_  
| _utility back into compliance to ensure that the service,_  
| _instrumentalities, and facilities are safe, adequate, efficient,_  
| _and reasonable._  
|  _(3)_ _____The commission may charge the water or sewer utility the_  
| _amount that was required to make the necessary repairs to replenish_

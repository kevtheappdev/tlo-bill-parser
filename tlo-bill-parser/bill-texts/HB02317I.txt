|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the requirements for meetings of certain special  
| districts.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 49.062, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (c) and adding Subsections (b-1),  
| (b-2), and (b-3) to read as follows:  
|  (b) The board shall designate one or more places inside or  
| outside the district for conducting the meetings of the board. The  
| meeting place may be a private residence or office, provided that  
| the board, in its order establishing the meeting place, declares  
| the same to be a public place and invites the public to attend any  
| meeting of the board.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The designated place must provide district residents_  
| _a reasonable opportunity to attend board meetings._  
|  _(b-2)_ If the board establishes a meeting place or places  
| outside the district _:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the place or places must be located within 10 miles_  
| _of the district boundaries; and_  
|  _(2) the board_ [ ~~, it~~ ] shall give notice of the location  
| or locations by filing a true copy of the resolution establishing  
| the location or locations of the meeting place or places with the  
| commission and also by publishing notice of the location or  
| locations in a newspaper of general circulation in the district.  
|  _(b-3)_ If the location of any of the meeting places outside  
| the district is changed, notice of the change shall be given in the  
| same manner.  
|  (c) After at least 25 qualified electors are residing in a  
| district, on _the_ written request of at least five of those electors  
| _for_ [ ~~,~~ ] the board _to_ [ ~~shall~~ ] designate a _different_ meeting
place _to_  
| _provide district residents a reasonable opportunity to attend_  
| _district meetings, the board shall determine whether_ [ ~~and hold~~  
|  ~~meetings within the district if it determines that~~ ] the _designated_  
| meeting place [ ~~used by the district~~ ] deprives the residents of a  
| reasonable opportunity to attend district meetings. On the _board's_  
| failure to designate _a different_ [ ~~the location of the~~ ] meeting  
| place _to provide district residents a reasonable opportunity to_  
| _attend district meetings_ [ ~~within the district~~ ], five electors may  
| petition the commission to designate a _different_ location. If _the_  
| _commission_ [ ~~it~~ ] determines that the meeting place used by the  
| district deprives the residents of a reasonable opportunity to  
| attend district meetings, the commission may designate a meeting  
| place inside or outside the district which is reasonably available  
| to the public and require that the meetings be held at _that_ [ ~~such~~ ]  
| place. After the next election, the board may designate different  
| meeting places, including one located outside the boundaries of the  
| district.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an open meeting held on or after the effective date of this Act. An  
| open meeting that is held before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date of the open meeting, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

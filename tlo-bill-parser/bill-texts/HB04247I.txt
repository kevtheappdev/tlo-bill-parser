|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the operation of rock and concrete crushing facilities  
| at certain locations.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 382.065, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 382.065. CERTAIN LOCATIONS FOR OPERATING _ROCK OR_  
| CONCRETE CRUSHING FACILITY PROHIBITED. (a)  The commission by rule  
| shall prohibit the operation of a _rock or_ concrete crushing  
| facility within _880_ [ ~~440~~ ] yards of a building in use as a single or  
| multifamily residence, school, place of worship, or _hospital_ at the  
| time the application for a permit to operate the facility at a site  
| near the residence, school, place of worship, or _hospital_ is filed  
| with the commission.  
|  _(a-1)_ The measurement of d  
| istance for purposes of  
| _Subsection (a)_ [ ~~this subsection~~ ] shall be taken from the point on  
| the _rock or_ concrete crushing facility that is nearest to the  
| residence, school, place of worship, or _hospital_ toward the point  
| on the residence, school, place of worship, or _hospital_ that is  
| nearest the _rock or_ concrete crushing facility.  _If a rock or_  
| _concrete crushing facility is to be located on a property that is_  
| _also used or to be used for aggregate production, the measurement of_  
| _distance shall be taken from the property line of the property used_  
| _or to be used for aggregate production._  
|  (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a _rock or_ concrete  
| crushing facility:  
|  (1) at a location for which commission authorization  
| for the operation of a _rock or_ concrete crushing facility was in  
| effect on September 1, 2001;  
|  (2) at a location that satisfies the distance  
| requirements of Subsection (a) at the time the application for the  
| initial authorization for the operation of that facility at that  
| location is filed with the commission, provided that the  
| authorization is granted and maintained, regardless of whether a  
| single or multifamily residence, school, place of worship, or  
| _hospital_ is subsequently built or put to use within _880_ [ ~~440~~ ]
yards  
| of the facility; or  
|  (3) that:  
|  (A) uses a concrete crusher:  
|  (i) in the manufacture of products that  
| contain recycled materials; and  
|  (ii) that is located in an enclosed  
| building; and  
|  (B) is located:  
|  (i) within 25 miles of an international  
| border; and  
|  (ii) in a municipality with a population of  
| not less than 6,100 but not more than 20,000.  
|  (c) [ ~~Except as provided by Subsection (d),~~ ] Subsection (a)  
| does not apply to a _rock or_ concrete crushing facility that:  
|  (1) is engaged in crushing _rock,_ concrete _,_ and other  
| materials produced by the demolition of a structure at the location  
| of the structure and the _rock,_ concrete _,_ and other materials are  
| being crushed primarily for use at that location;  
|  (2) operates at that location for not more than 180  
| days;  
|  (3) the commission determines will cause no adverse  
| environmental or health effects by operating at that location; and

| rules, including operating conditions.

applies~~  
|  ~~to a concrete crushing facility in a county with a population of 3.3~~  
|  ~~million or more or in a county adjacent to such a county.~~ ]  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an application for a permit to operate a rock or concrete  
| crushing facility that is filed on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.  An application for a permit filed before the effective  
| date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date of  
| filing, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution.  If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

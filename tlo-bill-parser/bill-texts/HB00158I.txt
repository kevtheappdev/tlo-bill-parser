|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the use of certain previous convictions for enhancing  
| the criminal penalty for certain subsequent criminal offenses.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter D, Chapter 12, Penal Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 12.415 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___12.415._ _____CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PREVIOUS OFFENSES_  
| _FOR PURPOSES OF SUBSEQUENT ENHANCEMENT. (a) This section applies_  
| _only to an offense for which the penalty was enhanced as the result_  
| _of a previous conviction under the terms of a provision other than a_  
| _provision under this subchapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____A defendant's conviction of an offense described by_  
| _Subsection (a) may be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent_  
| _offense for purposes of this subchapter based only on the class or_  
| _degree of offense that would have otherwise applied to the offense_  
| _described by Subsection (a) if the state had not proved the previous_  
| _conviction._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to the enhancement of punishment under Subchapter D, Chapter 12,  
| Penal Code, for an offense committed on or after the effective date  
| of this Act.  An offense committed before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was  
| committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  For purposes of this section, an offense was committed  
| before the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense  
| occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

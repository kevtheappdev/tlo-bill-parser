|  (1) a description of the real property being improved  
| legally sufficient to identify it;  
|  (2) whether there is a surety bond and if so, the name  
| and last known address of the surety and a copy of the bond;  
|  (3) whether there are any prior recorded liens or  
| security interests on the real property being improved and if so,  
| the name and address of the person having the lien or security  
| interest; and  
|  (4) the date on which the original contract for the  
| project was executed.  
|  (f) A person [ ~~, other than a claimant requested to furnish~~

| as required by this section is liable to the requesting person for  
| that person's reasonable and necessary costs incurred in procuring  
| the requested information.  
|  SECTION 25. Sections 53.160(a), (b), (c), and (e), Property  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) _An owner or original contractor may bring suit_ [ ~~In a~~  
|  ~~suit brought to foreclose a lien or~~ ] to declare a claim or lien  
| invalid or unenforceable [ ~~, a party objecting to the validity or~~  
|  ~~enforceability of the claim or lien may file a motion to remove the~~  
|  ~~claim or lien~~ ]. The _original petition or subsequent_ motion must [
~~be~~  
|  ~~verified and~~ ] state the legal and factual basis for objecting to the  
| validity or enforceability of the claim or lien _and must_ [ ~~.~~ ~~~~
~~The~~  
|  ~~motion may~~ ] be accompanied by supporting affidavits.  
|  (b) The grounds for objecting to the validity or  
| enforceability of the claim or lien for purposes of the motion are  
| limited to the following:  
|  (1) notice of claim was not _timely_ furnished to the  
| owner or original contractor as required by Section 53.056 _or_ [ ~~,~~ ]  
| 53.057 [ ~~, 53.058, 53.252, or 53.253~~ ];  
|  (2) an affidavit claiming a lien failed to comply with  
| Section 53.054 or was not filed as required by Section 53.052;  
|  (3) notice of the filed affidavit was not furnished to  
| the owner or original contractor as required by Section 53.055;  
|  (4) [ ~~the deadlines for perfecting a lien claim for~~  
|  ~~retainage under this chapter have expired and the owner complied~~  
|  ~~with the requirements of Section 53.101 and paid the retainage and~~  
|  ~~all other funds owed to the original contractor before:~~  
|  [ ~~(A) the claimant perfected the lien claim; and~~  
|  [ ~~(B)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the owner received a notice of the claim as~~  
|  ~~required by this chapter;~~  
|  [ ~~(5)~~ ] all funds subject to the notice of a claim to the  
| owner and a notice regarding the retainage have been deposited in  
| the registry of the court and the owner has no additional liability  
| to the claimant;  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(6)~~ ] when the lien affidavit was filed on  
| homestead property:  
|  (A) no contract was executed or filed as required  
| by Section 53.254;  
|  (B) the affidavit claiming a lien failed to  
| contain the notice as required by Section 53.254; or  
|  (C) the notice of the claim failed to include the  
| statement required by Section 53.254; and  
|  _(6)_ [ ~~(7)~~ ] the claimant executed a [ ~~valid and~~  
|  ~~enforceable~~ ] waiver or release of the claim or lien claimed in the  
| affidavit.  
|  (c) The claimant is not required to file a response.  The  
| claimant and any other party that has appeared in the proceeding  
| must be notified by at least _30_ [ ~~21~~ ] days before the date of the  
| hearing on the motion.  [ ~~A motion may not be heard before the 21st~~  
|  ~~day after the date the claimant answers or appears in the~~  
|  ~~proceeding.~~ ]  
|  (e) The court shall promptly determine a motion to remove a  
| claim or lien under this section _under the same standards as a_  
| _motion for summary judgment_. If the court determines that the  
| movant is not entitled to remove the lien, the court shall enter an  
| order denying the motion. If the court determines that the movant is  
| entitled to remove the lien, the court shall enter an order removing  
| the lien claimed in the lien affidavit. _The order is appealable if_  
| _the order is the final order in the case_ [ ~~A party to the proceeding~~  
|  ~~may not file an interlocutory appeal from the court's order~~ ].  
|  SECTION 26. Sections 53.161(a) and (g), Property Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the order removing a lien, the court shall set the  
| amount of security that the claimant may provide in order to  
| _preserve the potential validity of the lien claim on appeal_ [ ~~stay~~  
|  ~~the removal of the claim or lien~~ ].  The _amount of the security_ [
~~sum~~ ]  
| must be _at least 75 percent of the_ [ ~~an~~ ] amount _of the lien claim
plus_  
| [ ~~that the court determines is~~ ] a reasonable estimate of the costs  
| and attorney's fees the movant is likely to incur in the _appeal_  
| [ ~~proceeding~~ ] to determine the validity or enforceability of the  
| lien. [ ~~The sum may not exceed the amount of the lien claim.~~ ]  
|  (g) _If an appeal is not taken or if the bond or deposit is_  
| _not timely made, the_ [ ~~The~~ ] claim or lien is removed and extinguished  
| as to a creditor or subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration  
| who obtains an interest in the property [ ~~after the certified copy of~~  
|  ~~the order and certificate of the clerk of the court are filed with~~  
|  ~~the county clerk.~~ ~~~~ ~~The removal of the lien does not constitute
a~~  
|  ~~release of the liability of the owner, if any, to the claimant~~ ].  
|  SECTION 27. Section 53.205(a), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) The bond protects all persons with a claim that is [ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] perfected in the manner prescribed for fixing a  
| lien [ ~~under Subchapter C or, if the claim relates to a residential~~  
|  ~~construction project, under Subchapter K; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~perfected in the manner prescribed by Section~~  
|  ~~53.206~~ ].  
|  SECTION 28. Sections 53.206(a), (b), and (d), Property  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) To perfect a claim against a bond in a manner other than  
| that prescribed by Subchapter C [ ~~or K~~ ] for fixing a lien, a person  
| must [ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] give to the original contractor _and surety on_  
| _the bond_ all applicable notices under the appropriate subchapter [ ~~;~~  
|  ~~and~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~give to the surety on the bond, instead of the~~  
|  ~~owner, all notices under the appropriate subchapter required to be~~  
|  ~~given to the owner~~ ].  
|  (b) To perfect a claim under this section, a person is not  
| required to [ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~give notice to the surety under Section 53.057,~~  
|  ~~unless the claimant has a direct contractual relationship with the~~  
|  ~~original contractor and the agreed retainage is in excess of 10~~  
|  ~~percent of the contract;~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~give notice to the surety under Section 53.058(b)~~  
|  ~~or, if the claim relates to a residential construction project,~~  
|  ~~under Section 53.253(c); or~~  
|  [ ~~(3)~~ ] file any affidavit with the county clerk.  
|  (d) A person satisfies the requirements of this section  
| relating to providing notice to the surety if the person mails the  
| notice by certified [ ~~or registered~~ ] mail to the surety:  
|  (1) at the address stated on the bond or on an  
| attachment to the bond;  
|  (2) at the address on file with the Texas Department of  
| Insurance; or  
|  (3) at any other address allowed by law.  
|  SECTION 29. Section 53.207, Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 53.207. _FAILURE TO SEND_ [ ~~OWNER'S~~ ] NOTICE OF CLAIM TO  
| SURETY. [ ~~(a)~~ ] If the owner receives any of the notices or a lien is  
| fixed under _this chapter_ [ ~~Subchapter C or K~~ ], the _failure_ [
~~owner~~  
|  ~~shall mail to the surety on the bond a copy of all notices received.~~  
|  [ ~~(b) Failure~~] of the owner to send copies of notices to the  
| surety does not relieve the surety of any liability under the bond  
| if the claimant has complied with the requirements of this  
| subchapter, nor does that failure impose any liability on the  
| owner.  
|  SECTION 30. The heading to Section 53.254, Property Code,  
| is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 53.254. _CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS FOR LIEN ON_ HOMESTEAD.  
|  SECTION 31. Section 53.254(g), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (g) For the lien on a homestead to be valid, _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] notice  
| _must_ [ ~~required to~~ ] be given to the owner _with the original
contract_  
| _and_ [ ~~under Section 53.252~~ ] must include or have attached the  
| following statement:  
|  "If a subcontractor or supplier who furnishes materials or  
| performs labor for construction of improvements on your property is  
| not paid, your property may be subject to a lien for the unpaid  
| amount if[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ] after receiving notice of the unpaid claim from  
| the claimant, you fail to withhold payment to your contractor that  
| is sufficient to cover the unpaid claim until the dispute is  
| resolved _. Additionally, you may be liable for up to an additional_  
| _10 percent of the price of the original contract for contractual_  
| _retainage claims"_ [ ~~; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~during construction and for 30 days after~~  
|  ~~completion of construction, you fail to retain 10 percent of the~~  
|  ~~contract price or 10 percent of the value of the work performed by~~  
|  ~~your contractor~~ ].  
|  [ ~~"If you have complied with the law regarding the 10 percent~~  
|  ~~retainage and you have withheld payment to the contractor~~  
|  ~~sufficient to cover any written notice of claim and have paid that~~  
|  ~~amount, if any, to the claimant, any lien claim filed on your~~  
|  ~~property by a subcontractor or supplier, other than a person who~~  
|  ~~contracted directly with you, will not be a valid lien on your~~  
|  ~~property. In addition, except for the required 10 percent~~  
|  ~~retainage, you are not liable to a subcontractor or supplier for any~~  
|  ~~amount paid to your contractor before you received written notice~~  
|  ~~of the claim."~~ ]  
|  SECTION 32. Section 53.255(b), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) The disclosure statement must read substantially  
| similar to the following:  
|  "KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW. You  
| are about to enter into a transaction to build a new home or remodel  
| existing residential property. Texas law requires your contractor  
| to provide you with this brief overview of some of your rights,  
| responsibilities, and risks in this transaction.  
|  "CONVEYANCE TO CONTRACTOR NOT REQUIRED. Your contractor may  
| not require you to convey your real property to your contractor as a  
| condition to the agreement for the construction of improvements on  
| your property.  
|  "KNOW YOUR CONTRACTOR. Before you enter into your agreement  
| for the construction of improvements to your real property, make  
| sure that you have investigated your contractor. Obtain and verify  
| references from other people who have used the contractor for the  
| type and size of construction project on your property.  
|  "GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure that you have a written  
| agreement with your contractor that includes: (1) a description of  
| the work the contractor is to perform; (2) the required or  
| estimated time for completion of the work; (3) the cost of the work  
| or how the cost will be determined; and (4) the procedure and  
| method of payment, including provisions for [ ~~statutory~~ ] retainage  
| and conditions for final payment. If your contractor made a  
| promise, warranty, or representation to you concerning the work the  
| contractor is to perform, make sure that promise, warranty, or  
| representation is specified in the written agreement. An oral  
| promise that is not included in the written agreement may not be  
| enforceable under Texas law.  
|  "READ BEFORE YOU SIGN. Do not sign any document before you  
| have read and understood it. NEVER SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDES AN  
| UNTRUE STATEMENT. Take your time in reviewing documents. If you  
| borrow money from a lender to pay for the improvements, you are  
| entitled to have the loan closing documents furnished to you for  
| review at least one business day before the closing. Do not waive  
| this requirement unless a bona fide emergency or another good cause  
| exists, and make sure you understand the documents before you sign  
| them. If you fail to comply with the terms of the documents, you  
| could lose your property. You are entitled to have your own  
| attorney review any documents. If you have any question about the  
| meaning of a document, consult an attorney.  
|  "GET A LIST OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Before  
| construction commences, your contractor is required to provide you  
| with a list of the subcontractors and suppliers the contractor  
| intends to use on your project. Your contractor is required to  
| supply updated information on any subcontractors and suppliers  
| added after the list is provided. Your contractor is not required  
| to supply this information if you sign a written waiver of your  
| rights to receive this information.  
|  "MONITOR THE WORK. Lenders and governmental authorities may  
| inspect the work in progress from time to time for their own  
| purposes. These inspections are not intended as quality control  
| inspections. Quality control is a matter for you and your  
| contractor. To ensure that your home is being constructed in  
| accordance with your wishes and specifications, you should inspect  
| the work yourself or have your own independent inspector review the  
| work in progress.  
|  "MONITOR PAYMENTS. If you use a lender, your lender is  
| required to provide you with a periodic statement showing the money  
| disbursed by the lender from the proceeds of your loan. Each time  
| your contractor requests payment from you or your lender for work  
| performed, your contractor is also required to furnish you with a  
| disbursement statement that lists the name and address of each  
| subcontractor or supplier that the contractor intends to pay from  
| the requested funds. Review these statements and make sure that the  
| money is being properly disbursed.  
|  "CLAIMS BY SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Under Texas law, if  
| a subcontractor or supplier who furnishes labor or materials for  
| the construction of improvements on your property is not paid, you  
| may become liable and your property may be subject to a lien for the  
| unpaid amount, even if you have not contracted directly with the  
| subcontractor or supplier. To avoid liability, you should take the  
| following actions:  
|  (1) If you receive a written notice from a  
| subcontractor or supplier, you should withhold payment from your  
| contractor for the amount of the claim stated in the notice until  
| the dispute between your contractor and the subcontractor or  
| supplier is resolved. If your lender is disbursing money directly  
| to your contractor, you should immediately provide a copy of the  
| notice to your lender and instruct the lender to withhold payment in  
| the amount of the claim stated in the notice. If you continue to pay  
| the contractor after receiving the written notice without  
| withholding the amount of the claim, you may be liable and your  
| property may be subject to a lien for the amount you failed to  
| withhold.  
|  (2) During construction and for 30 days after final  
| completion, termination, or abandonment of the contract by the  
| contractor, you should withhold or cause your lender to withhold  
| _the greater of the amount you are required to withhold under the_  
| _contract or an amount equal to_ 10 percent of the amount of payments  
| made for the work performed by your contractor. This is [ ~~sometimes~~ ]  
| referred to as [ ~~'statutory~~ ] retainage.[ ~~'~~ ] If you choose not to  
| withhold _at least_ [ ~~the~~ ] 10 percent for at least 30 days after final  
| completion, termination, or abandonment of the contract by the  
| contractor and if a valid claim is timely made by a claimant and  
| your contractor fails to pay the claim, you may be personally liable  
| and your property may be subject to a lien up to the amount that you  
| failed to withhold.  
|  "If a claim is not paid within a certain time period, the  
| claimant is required to file a mechanic's lien affidavit in the real  
| property records in the county where the property is located. A  
| mechanic's lien affidavit is not a lien on your property, but the  
| filing of the affidavit could result in a court imposing a lien on  
| your property if the claimant is successful in litigation to  
| enforce the lien claim.  
|  "SOME CLAIMS MAY NOT BE VALID. When you receive a written  
| notice of a claim or when a mechanic's lien affidavit is filed on  
| your property, you should know your legal rights and  
| responsibilities regarding the claim. Not all claims are valid. A  
| notice of a claim by a subcontractor or supplier is required to be  
| sent, and the mechanic's lien affidavit is required to be filed,  
| within strict time periods. The notice and the affidavit must  
| contain certain information. All claimants may not fully comply  
| with the legal requirements to collect on a claim. If you have paid  
| the contractor in full before receiving a notice of a claim and have  
| fully complied with the law regarding [ ~~statutory~~ ] retainage, you  
| may not be liable for that claim. Accordingly, you should consult  
| your attorney when you receive a written notice of a claim to  
| determine the true extent of your liability or potential liability  
| for that claim.  
|  "OBTAIN A LIEN RELEASE AND A BILLS-PAID AFFIDAVIT. When you  
| receive a notice of claim, do not release withheld funds without  
| obtaining a signed and notarized release of lien and claim from the  
| claimant. You can also reduce the risk of having a claim filed by a  
| subcontractor or supplier by requiring as a condition of each  
| payment made by you or your lender that your contractor furnish you  
| with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. Under  
| Texas law, on final completion of the work and before final payment,  
| the contractor is required to furnish you with an affidavit stating  
| that all bills have been paid. If the contractor discloses any  
| unpaid bill in the affidavit, you should withhold payment in the  
| amount of the unpaid bill until you receive a waiver of lien or  
| release from that subcontractor or supplier.  
|  "OBTAIN TITLE INSURANCE PROTECTION. You may be able to obtain  
| a title insurance policy to insure that the title to your property  
| and the existing improvements on your property are free from liens  
| claimed by subcontractors and suppliers. If your policy is issued  
| before the improvements are completed and covers the value of the  
| improvements to be completed, you should obtain, on the completion  
| of the improvements and as a condition of your final payment, a '  
| completion of improvements' policy endorsement. This endorsement  
| will protect your property from liens claimed by subcontractors and  
| suppliers that may arise from the date the original title policy is  
| issued to the date of the endorsement."  
|  SECTION 33. Section 53.281(b), Property Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) A waiver and release is effective to release the owner,  
| the owner's property, the contractor, and the surety on a payment  
| bond from claims and liens only if:  
|  (1) the waiver and release substantially complies with  
| one of the forms prescribed by Section 53.284;  
|  (2) the waiver and release is signed by the claimant or  
| the claimant's authorized agent [ ~~and notarized~~ ]; and  
|  (3) in the case of a conditional release, evidence of  
| payment to the claimant exists.  
|  SECTION 34. Sections 53.282(a) and (b), Property Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) A statement purporting to waive, release, or otherwise  
| adversely affect a lien or payment bond claim is not enforceable and  
| does not create an estoppel or impairment of a lien or payment bond  
| claim unless:  
|  (1) the statement is in writing and substantially  
| complies with a form prescribed by Section 53.284;  
|  (2) _for a conditional lien waiver,_ the claimant has  
| actually received payment in good and sufficient funds in full for  
| the lien or payment bond claim; or  
|  (3) the statement is:  
|  (A) in a written original contract or subcontract  
| for the construction, remodel, or repair of a single-family house,  
| townhouse, or duplex or for land development related to a  
| single-family house, townhouse, or duplex; and  
|  (B) made before labor or materials are provided  
| under the original contract or subcontract.  
|  (b) The filing of a lien rendered unenforceable by a lien  
| waiver under Subsection (a)(3) _is a violation of_ [ ~~does not violate~~ ]  
| Section 12.002, Civil Practice and Remedies Code[ ~~, unless:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~an owner or original contractor sends a written~~  
|  ~~explanation of the basis for nonpayment, evidence of the~~  
|  ~~contractual waiver of lien rights, and a notice of request for~~  
|  ~~release of the lien to the claimant at the claimant's address stated~~  
|  ~~in the lien affidavit; and~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the lien claimant does not release the filed lien~~  
|  ~~affidavit on or before the 14th day after the date the owner or the~~  
|  ~~original contractor sends the items required by Subdivision (1)~~ ].  
|  SECTION 35. Sections 53.284(b) and (c), Property Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) If a claimant or potential claimant is required to  
| execute a waiver and release in exchange for or to induce the  
| payment of a progress payment and is not paid in exchange for the  
| waiver and release or if a single payee check or joint payee check  
| is given in exchange for the waiver and release, the waiver and  
| release must read:

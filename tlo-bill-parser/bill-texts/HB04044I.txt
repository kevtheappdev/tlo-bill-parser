|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the funding of community supervision and corrections  
| departments.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 509.011, Government Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (e), and (f) and adding Subsections  
| (e-1), (f-1), and (i) to read as follows:  
|  (a) If the division determines that a department complies  
| with division standards and if the department has submitted a  
| strategic plan under Section 509.007 and the supporting information  
| required by the division and the division determines the plan and  
| supporting information are acceptable, the division shall prepare  
| and submit to the comptroller vouchers for payment to the  
| department as follows:  
|  (1) for per capita funding, a per diem amount _based on_  
| _the formula established under Subsection (e)_ for each felony  
| defendant _who is_ [ ~~directly~~ ] supervised by the department pursuant  
| to lawful authority _and:_  
|  _(A) placed on community supervision; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____participating in a pretrial service or_  
| _intervention program_ ;  
|  (2) for per capita funding, a per diem amount _based on_  
| _the formula established under Subsection (e)_ for a period not to  
| exceed 182 days for each _misdemeanor_ defendant _who is_ supervised by  
| the department pursuant to lawful authority _and placed on community_  
| _supervision_ [ ~~, other than a felony defendant~~ ]; and  
|  (3) for formula funding, an annual amount as computed  
| by multiplying a percentage determined by the allocation formula  
| established under Subsection (f) times the total amount provided in  
| the General Appropriations Act for payments under this subdivision.  
|  (e) _The division annually shall establish a per capita_  
| _funding formula to determine the percentage of the total amount_  
| _provided in the General Appropriations Act for payments under_  
| _Subsections (a)(1) and (2) that each department is entitled to_  
| _receive. For purposes of funding distributed for a defendant_  
| _described by Subsection (a)(1)(A), the formula must include:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a higher per capita funding rate for the_  
| _supervision of a defendant during the earliest period of the_  
| _defendant's community supervision term than the rate for the_  
| _supervision of a defendant during a later period of the defendant's_  
| _community supervision term;_  
|  _(2)_ _____provisions to decrease per capita funding for each_  
| _defendant supervised by a department who has the defendant's_  
| _community supervision revoked due to a technical violation of a_  
| _condition of community supervision; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____provisions to award additional per capita funding_  
| _based on each defendant supervised by a department who receives a_  
| _discharge following an early termination of community supervision_  
| _under Article 42A.111 or 42A.701, Code of Criminal Procedure, as_  
| _applicable._  
|  _(e-1)_ In establishing _the per capita funding formula under_  
| _Subsection (e)_ [ ~~per diem payments authorized by Subsections (a)(1)~~  
|  ~~and (a)(2)~~ ], the division shall consider the amounts appropriated  
| in the General Appropriations Act for basic supervision as  
| sufficient to provide basic supervision in each year of the fiscal  
| biennium.  
|  (f) The division annually shall compute for each department  
| for community corrections program formula funding a percentage  
| determined by assigning equal weights to the percentage of the  
| state's population residing in the counties served by the  
| department and the department's percentage of all felony defendants  
| in the state under direct community supervision. The division  
| shall use the most recent information available in making  
| computations under this subsection.  
|  _(f-1)_ The board by rule may adopt a policy limiting for all  
| departments the percentage of benefit or loss that may be realized  
| as a result of the operation of _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] formula _established under_  
| _Subsection (e) or (f)_.  
|  _(i)_ _____In this section, "technical violation"_ ___means any_  
| _violation of a condition of community supervision committed by a_  
| _defendant other than a violation that involves:_  
|  _(1)_ _____being arrested for, charged with, or convicted of_  
| _an offense:_  
|  _(A) punishable as a felony; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____under Title 5, Penal Code, that is punishable_  
| _as a misdemeanor;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the operation of a motor vehicle in a public place_  
| _while intoxicated, regardless of whether the defendant was arrested_  
| _for, charged with, or convicted of an offense based on that conduct;_  
|  _(3)_ _____a failure to report to a supervision officer as_  
| _directed for 90 days or more if the supervision officer or a peace_  
| _officer or other officer attempted to contact the defendant in_  
| _person at the defendant's last known residential or employment_  
| _address; or_  
|  _(4) leaving the state without permission._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 509.014(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The division shall:  
|  (1) review the funding formulas specified under  
| Section 509.011 and study the feasibility of adopting _additional_  
| performance-based _components_ [ ~~funding formulas~~ ], including whether  
| the formulas should take into consideration an offender's risk  
| level or other appropriate factors in allocating funding; and  
|  (2) make recommendations for modifying the current  
| funding formulas.  
|  SECTION 3. (a) Not later than January 1, 2020, the  
| community justice assistance division of the Texas Department of  
| Criminal Justice shall establish the per capita funding formula  
| required by Section 509.011(e), Government Code, as amended by this  
| Act, that is to be used for the state fiscal year beginning  
| September 1, 2020.  
|  (b) Section 509.011, Government Code, as amended by this  
| Act, applies only to a payment based on an appropriation made for  
| any state fiscal year beginning on or after September 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

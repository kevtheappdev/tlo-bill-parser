| prevented by the permittee or licensee by the exercise of due  
| diligence;  
|  (2) that the permittee or licensee was entrapped; or

| information on a driver's license, commercial driver's license, or  
| identification certificate, or _biometric identity verification_  
| _device_ for the purpose of complying with this code or a rule of the  
| commission, including for the purpose of preventing the person from  
| committing an offense under this code.  
|  (b) A person may not retain information accessed under this  
| section unless the commission by rule requires the information to  
| be retained. The person may not retain the information longer than  
| the commission requires.  
|  (b-1) Information retained may be printed to hard copy with  
| a time and date confirmation from the transaction scan device or  
| transferred to an electronic encrypted data storage or electronic  
| record.  After printing or transferring data, the transaction scan  
| device may clear the scanned information from the device or any

| requirements for the retention of information under this  
| subsection.  
|  (c) Information accessed under this section may not be  
| marketed in any manner.

| An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.  
|  (e) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this  
| code, for an offense having as an element the age of a person, that:  
|  (1) a transaction scan device _or biometric identity_  
| _verification device_ identified the license or certificate of the  
| purchaser as valid and that the person is over 21, and the defendant  
| accessed the information and relied on the results in good faith; or  
|  (2) if the defendant is the owner of a store in which  
| alcoholic beverages are sold at retail, the offense occurs in  
| connection with a sale by an employee of the owner, and the owner  
| had provided the employee with:  
|  (A) a transaction scan device _or biometric_  
| _identity verification device_ in working condition;  
|  (B) adequate training in the use of the  
| transaction scan device _or biometric identity verification device_ ;  
| and  
|  (C) the defendant did not directly or indirectly  
| encourage the employee to violate the law.  
|  (f) The defense offered in Subsection (e) does not apply  
| _applies_ in actions to cancel, deny, or suspend the license or  
| permit, except as provided by rules adopted by the commission under  
| Section 5.31.  
|  (g) In this section, "transaction scan device" includes an  
| electronic age verification system authorized by commission rule  
| operated in conjunction with a point of sale terminal that scans the  
| purchaser's driver's license or identification certificate upon  
| enrollment, associates the purchaser's personal identifying  
| information, as defined by Section 521.002(1)(C), Business &  
| Commerce Code, with the purchaser's license or identification  
| certificate information, and is capable of allowing a seller to  
| verify a purchaser's age solely by accessing the data and  
| information.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

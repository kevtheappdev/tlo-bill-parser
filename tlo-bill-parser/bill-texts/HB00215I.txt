|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 2, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Article 2.081 to read as follows:  
|  _Art._ ___2.081._ _____APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR_  
| _OFFICER-INVOLVED INJURIES OR DEATHS. (a) In this article:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Local law enforcement agency" means an agency of_  
| _a political subdivision of the state authorized by law to employ_  
| _peace officers._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Officer-involved injury or death" means any_  
| _serious bodily injury or death caused by a peace officer acting_  
| _under the authority of a political subdivision of the state._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Prosecuting attorney" means a district attorney,_  
| _criminal district attorney, or county attorney._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Serious bodily injury" has the meaning assigned_  
| _by Section 1.07, Penal Code._  
|  _(b)_ _____With respect to any offense arising out of an_  
| _officer-involved injury or death, a prosecuting attorney is_  
| _disqualified from prosecuting a peace officer who is employed by a_  
| _political subdivision of this state that is also served by the_  
| _attorney._  
|  _(c)_ _____As soon as practicable after an officer-involved injury_  
| _or death, the local law enforcement agency employing the peace_  
| _officer or officers involved shall report the incident to the_  
| _attorney general._  
|  _(d)_ _____Notwithstanding Article 2.07(a), the attorney general_  
| _shall appoint a special prosecutor to perform the duties of a_  
| _prosecuting attorney in a case for which the prosecuting attorney_  
| _is disqualified under Subsection (b)._ ___Except as provided by_  
| _Subsection (e), the special prosecutor must be a duly elected_  
| _prosecuting attorney for a county that is adjacent to the county_  
| _served by the prosecuting attorney who is disqualified under_  
| _Subsection (b) from prosecuting the offense arising out of an_  
| _officer-involved injury or death._  
|  _(e)_ _____A duly elected prosecuting attorney appointed as_  
| _special prosecutor under Subsection (d) may decline the appointment_  
| _by providing written notice to the attorney general stating why it_  
| _is impracticable for the attorney to prosecute the case. If each_  
| _duly elected prosecuting attorney described by Subsection (d)_  
| _declines the appointment as permitted by this subsection, the_  
| _attorney general may appoint as special prosecutor any duly elected_  
| _prosecuting attorney who is not otherwise disqualified from_  
| _prosecuting the offense arising out of an officer-involved injury_  
| _or death._  
|  _(f)_ _____A local law enforcement agency that submits a report_  
| _under Subsection (c) shall cooperate with the special prosecutor_  
| _appointed by the attorney general under this article in the_  
| _prosecution of any offense arising out of an officer-involved_  
| _injury or death._  
|  SECTION 2. (a) Not later than February 1, 2020, each local  
| law enforcement agency shall comply with the requirements under  
| Article 2.081, Code of Criminal Procedure, as added by this Act.  
|  (b) Article 2.081, Code of Criminal Procedure, as added by  
| this Act, applies only to the prosecution of an offense arising out  
| of an officer-involved injury or death commencing on or after  
| February 1, 2020. The prosecution of an offense arising out of an  
| officer-involved injury or death commencing before February 1,  
| 2020, is governed by the law in effect on the date the prosecution  
| commenced, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose. For purposes of this subsection, "officer-involved injury  
| or death" has the meaning assigned by Article 2.081(a), Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, as added by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, requiring the attorney general to appoint a  
| special prosecutor to prosecute certain offenses that are committed  
| by peace officers is approved by the voters. If that amendment is  
| not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

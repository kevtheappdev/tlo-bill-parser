|  AN ACT  
| relating to procedures and reporting requirements regarding  
| criminal defendants who are or may be persons with a mental illness  
| or an intellectual disability.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
| SECTION 1. Article 16.22(a), Code of Criminal Procedure, as  
| amended by Chapters 748 (S.B. 1326) and 950 (S.B. 1849), Acts of the  
| 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, is reenacted and amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a)(1) Not later than 12 hours after the sheriff or  
| municipal jailer having custody of a defendant for an offense  
| punishable as a Class B misdemeanor or any higher category of  
| offense receives credible information that may establish  
| reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has a mental illness  
| or is a person with an intellectual disability, the sheriff or  
| municipal jailer shall provide written or electronic notice to the  
| magistrate. The notice must include any information related to the  
| sheriff's or municipal jailer's determination, such as information  
| regarding the defendant's behavior immediately before, during, and  
| after the defendant's arrest and, if applicable, the results of any  
| previous assessment of the defendant. On a determination that  
| there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has a mental  
| illness or is a person with an intellectual disability, the  
| magistrate, except as provided by Subdivision (2), shall order the  
| local mental health authority, local intellectual and  
| developmental disability authority, or another qualified mental  
| health or intellectual disability expert to:  
|  (A) _interview the defendant and otherwise_  
| collect information regarding whether the defendant has a mental  
| illness as defined by Section 571.003, Health and Safety Code, or is  
| a person with an intellectual disability as defined by Section  
| 591.003, Health and Safety Code, including, if applicable,  
| information obtained from any previous assessment of the defendant  
| and information regarding any previously recommended treatment _or_  
| _service_ ; and  
|  (B) provide to the magistrate a written _report_  
| [ ~~assessment~~ ] of the _interview and other_ information collected under  
| Paragraph (A) on the form approved by the Texas Correctional Office  
| on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments under Section  
| _614.0032(c)_ [ ~~614.0032(b)~~ ], Health and Safety Code.  
|  (2) The magistrate is not required to order the  
| _interview and_ collection of _other_ information under Subdivision (1)  
| if the defendant in the year preceding the defendant's applicable  
| date of arrest has been determined to have a mental illness or to be  
| a person with an intellectual disability by the local mental health  
| authority, local intellectual and developmental disability  
| authority, or another mental health or intellectual disability  
| expert described by Subdivision (1). A court that elects to use the  
| results of that previous determination may proceed under Subsection  
| (c).  
|  (3) If the defendant fails or refuses to submit to the  
| _interview and_ collection of _other_ information regarding the  
| defendant as required under Subdivision (1), the magistrate may  
| order the defendant to submit to an examination in a jail or in  
| another place determined to be appropriate by the local mental  
| health authority or local intellectual and developmental  
| disability authority for a reasonable period not to exceed 72  
| hours. If applicable, the county in which the committing court is  
| located shall reimburse the local mental health authority or local  
| intellectual and developmental disability authority for the  
| mileage and per diem expenses of the personnel required to  
| transport the defendant, calculated in accordance with the state  
| travel regulations in effect at the time.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 16.22, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (b), (b-1), (c), (d), and (e) and  
| adding Subsection (f) to read as follows:

| cause shown, a written _report_ [ ~~assessment~~ ] of the _interview and_  
| _other_ information collected under Subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be  
| provided to the magistrate:  
|  (1) for a defendant held in custody, not later than 96  
| hours after the time an order was issued under Subsection (a); or  
|  (2) for a defendant released from custody, not later  
| than the 30th day after the date an order was issued under  
| Subsection (a).  
|  (b-1) The magistrate shall provide copies of the written  
| _report_ [ ~~assessment~~ ] to the defense counsel, the attorney  
| representing the state, and the trial court. The written _report_  
| [ ~~assessment~~ ] must include a description of the procedures used in  
| the _interview and_ collection of _other_ information under Subsection

| pertaining to:  
|  (1) whether the defendant is a person who has a mental  
| illness or is a person with an intellectual disability;  
|  (2) whether there is clinical evidence to support a  
| belief that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial and  
| should undergo a complete competency examination under Subchapter  
| B, Chapter 46B; and  
|  (3) any appropriate or recommended treatment or  
| service.  
|  (c) After the trial court receives the applicable expert's  
| written _report_ [ ~~assessment~~ ] relating to the defendant under

| or intellectual disability services, including proceedings related  
| to the defendant's receipt of outpatient mental health services  
| under Section 574.034, Health and Safety Code;  
|  (3) consider the written _report_ [ ~~assessment~~ ] during  
| the punishment phase after a conviction of the offense for which the  
| defendant was arrested, as part of a presentence investigation  
| report, or in connection with the impositions of conditions  
| following placement on community supervision, including deferred  
| adjudication community supervision; or  
|  (4) refer the defendant to an appropriate specialty  
| court established or operated under Subtitle K, Title 2, Government  
| Code.  
|  (d) This article does not prevent the applicable court from,  
| before, during, or after the _interview and_ collection of _other_  
| information regarding the defendant as described by this article:  
|  (1) releasing a defendant who has a mental illness or  
| is a person with an intellectual disability from custody on  
| personal or surety bond, including imposing as a condition of  
| release that the defendant submit to an examination or other  
| assessment; or  
|  (2) ordering an examination regarding the defendant's

_a_  
| [ ~~the~~ ] court under Subsection (a)(1)(B).  _The rules must require_  
| _submission of the reports to the Office of Court Administration of_  
| _the Texas Judicial System on a monthly basis._  
|  _(f)_ _____A written report submitted to a magistrate under_  
| _Subsection (a)(1)(B) is confidential and not subject to disclosure_  
| _under Chapter 552, Government Code, but may be used or disclosed as_

|  SECTION 3. Articles 17.032(b) and (c), Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, as amended by Chapters 748 (S.B. 1326) and 950 (S.B.  
| 1849), Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, are  
| reenacted and amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Article 17.03(b), or a bond schedule  
| adopted or a standing order entered by a judge, a magistrate shall  
| release a defendant on personal bond unless good cause is shown  
| otherwise if:  
|  (1) the defendant is not charged with and has not been  
| previously convicted of a violent offense;  
|  (2) the defendant is examined by the local mental  
| health authority, local intellectual and developmental disability

|  (5) the magistrate finds, after considering all the  
| circumstances, a pretrial risk assessment, if applicable, and any  
| other credible information provided by the attorney representing  
| the state or the defendant, that release on personal bond would  
| reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court as required  
| and the safety of the community and the victim of the alleged  
| offense.

| requiring treatment _or services_ , shall require as a condition of

| disability expert if the defendant's:

| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 158.009. POWERS OF THE COMMISSION _AND SUPPLEMENTAL_

| substitute its judgment for the judgment of the commission _or a_  
| _supplemental commission_ on the weight of the evidence on questions  
| committed to the _commission's or supplemental_ commission's  
| discretion but:

| commission _or supplemental commission, as applicable,_ shall send to  
| the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire  
| record of the proceeding under review. The record shall be filed  
| with the clerk of the court. The record may be shortened by  
| stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings. The court may  
| assess additional costs against a party who unreasonably refuses to  
| stipulate to limit the record, unless the party pays all costs of  
| record preparation. The court may require or permit later  
| corrections or additions to the record.  
|  (b) A party may apply to the court to present additional  
| evidence. If the court is satisfied that the additional evidence is  
| material and that there were good reasons for the failure to present  
| it in the proceeding before the commission _or supplemental_  
| _commission_ , the court may order that the additional evidence be  
| taken before the commission _or supplemental commission, as_  
| _applicable,_ on conditions determined by the court. The commission  
| _or supplemental commission, as applicable,_ may change its findings  
| and decisions by reason of the additional evidence and shall file  
| the additional evidence and any changes, new findings, or decisions  
| with the reviewing court.  
|  (c) The party seeking judicial review shall offer, and the  
| reviewing court shall admit, the commission _or supplemental_  
| _commission_ record _, as applicable,_ into evidence as an exhibit.

| jury and is confined to the commission _or supplemental commission_  
| record, _as applicable,_ except that the court may receive evidence  
| of procedural irregularities alleged to have occurred before the  
| commission _or supplemental commission_ that are not reflected in the  
| record.  
|  SECTION 10. The heading to Section 158.0123, Local

| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commission _or supplemental commission, as_  
| _applicable,_ may require a party who appeals a final decision under  
| Section 158.012 to pay one-half of the cost of preparation of the  
| original or a certified copy of the record of the [ ~~commission~~ ]  
| proceeding that is required to be sent to the reviewing court.  
|  SECTION 12. This Act takes effect immediately if it  
| receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each

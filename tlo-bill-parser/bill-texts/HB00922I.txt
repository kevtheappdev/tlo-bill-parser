|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a divorce on the ground of insupportability.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 6.001, Family Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 6.001. INSUPPORTABILITY. On the petition of either  
| party to a marriage, the court may grant a divorce without regard to  
| fault if _both parties to the marriage agree that_ the marriage has  
| become insupportable because of discord or conflict of  
| personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital  
| relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of  
| reconciliation.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a suit for divorce that is filed on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A suit for divorce filed before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect immediately before the  
| effective date of this Act, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to application requirements for low income housing tax  
| credits for developments financed through the private activity bond  
| program.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2306.67071(a), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Before submitting to the department an application for  
| housing tax credits for developments financed through the private  
| activity bond program, including private activity bonds issued by  
| the department, the Texas State Affordable Housing Corporation, or  
| a local issuer, an applicant must provide notice of the intent to  
| file the application to:  
|  (1) the governing body of a municipality in which the  
| proposed development site is to be located;  
|  (2) subject to Subdivision (3), the commissioners  
| court of a county in which the proposed development site is to be  
| located, if the proposed site is to be located in an area of a county  
| that is not part of a municipality; or  
|  (3) the commissioners court of a county in which the  
| proposed development site is to be located and the governing body of  
| the applicable municipality, if the proposed site is to be located  
| in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality _with a_  
| _population of less than two million_.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an application for low income housing tax credits that is  
| submitted to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs  
| during an application cycle that is based on the 2020 qualified  
| allocation plan or a subsequent plan adopted by the governing board  
| of the department. An application that is submitted during an  
| application cycle that is based on an earlier qualified allocation  
| plan is governed by the law in effect on the date the application  
| cycle began, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

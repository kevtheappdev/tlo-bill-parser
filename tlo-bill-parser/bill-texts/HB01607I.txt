|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a deduction under the franchise tax for certain  
| contracts with the federal government.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) Texas is an epicenter of this nation's aerospace,  
| aviation, defense, and military industries;  
|  (2) with NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, the  
| new Army Futures Command, 15 active military bases across the  
| state, and major military aircraft manufacturing and maintenance  
| operations, the Texas economy and our nation's aerospace and  
| defense capabilities are inextricably linked;  
|  (3) these crucial industries employ tens of thousands  
| of Texans and support dozens of our communities across the state;  
| and  
|  (4) it is therefore paramount that state tax policy  
| foster a competitive economic climate to ensure growth and  
| retention of jobs related to the development, manufacture,  
| maintenance, and ongoing services for military hardware, aircraft,  
| spacecraft, and weapons systems used by and produced for our armed  
| forces, related federal government agencies, and our global allies.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 171.101(a), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) The taxable margin of a taxable entity is computed by:  
|  (1) determining the taxable entity's margin, which is  
| the lesser of:  
|  (A) the amount provided by this paragraph, which  
| is the lesser of:  
|  (i) 70 percent of the taxable entity's total  
| revenue from its entire business, as determined under Section  
| 171.1011; or  
|  (ii) an amount equal to the taxable entity's  
| total revenue from its entire business as determined under Section  
| 171.1011 minus $1 million; or  
|  (B) an amount computed by determining the taxable  
| entity's total revenue from its entire business under Section  
| 171.1011 and subtracting the greater of:  
|  (i) $1 million; or  
|  (ii) an amount equal to the sum of:  
|  (a) at the election of the taxable  
| entity, either:  
|  (1) cost of goods sold, as  
| determined under Section 171.1012; or  
|  (2) compensation, as determined  
| under Section 171.1013; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (b) any compensation, as determined  
| under Section 171.1013, paid to an individual during the period the  
| individual is serving on active duty as a member of the armed forces  
| of the United States if the individual is a resident of this state  
| at the time the individual is ordered to active duty and the cost of  
| training a replacement for the individual; _and_  
|  _(c)_ _____any costs not already subtracted_  
| _under Sub-subparagraph (a) that are properly allowable under the_  
| _Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Chapter 1), or a_  
| _successor regulation, for contracts, or subcontracts supporting_  
| _those contracts, for the sale of goods or services to the federal_  
| _government by a taxable entity that is a party to at least one_  
| _contract subject to the requirements of 48 C.F.R. Chapter 2;_  
|  (2) apportioning the taxable entity's margin to this  
| state as provided by Section 171.106 to determine the taxable  
| entity's apportioned margin; and  
|  (3) subtracting from the amount computed under  
| Subdivision (2) any other allowable deductions to determine the  
| taxable entity's taxable margin.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act applies only to a report originally due  
| on or after January 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the amount of a fine and costs discharged by a defendant  
| while confined in jail or engaged in labor.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 43.09(a), Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) When a defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor and the  
| defendant's punishment is assessed at a pecuniary fine or is  
| confined in a jail after conviction of a felony for which a fine is  
| imposed, if the defendant is unable to pay the fine and costs  
| adjudged against the defendant, the defendant may for such time as  
| will satisfy the judgment be put to work in the county jail  
| industries program, in the workhouse, or on the county farm, or  
| public improvements and maintenance projects of the county or a  
| political subdivision located in whole or in part in the county, as  
| provided in Article 43.10; or if there is no such county jail  
| industries program, workhouse, farm, or improvements and  
| maintenance projects, the defendant shall be confined in jail for a  
| sufficient length of time to discharge the full amount of fine and  
| costs adjudged against the defendant; rating such confinement at  
| _$200_ [ ~~$100~~ ] for each day and rating such labor at _$200_ [ ~~$100~~
] for  
| each day; provided, however, that the defendant may pay the  
| pecuniary fine assessed against the defendant at any time while the  
| defendant is serving at work in the county jail industries program,  
| in the workhouse, or on the county farm, or on the public  
| improvements and maintenance projects of the county or a political  
| subdivision located in whole or in part in the county, or while the  
| defendant is serving the defendant's jail sentence, and in such  
| instances the defendant is entitled to the credit earned under this  
| subsection during the time that the defendant has served and the  
| defendant shall only be required to pay the balance of the pecuniary  
| fine assessed against the defendant.  A defendant who performs  
| labor under this article during a day in which the defendant is  
| confined is entitled to both the credit for confinement and the  
| credit for labor provided by this article.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 45.048, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Art. 45.048. DISCHARGED FROM JAIL. (a) A defendant placed  
| in jail on account of failure to pay the fine and costs shall be  
| discharged on habeas corpus by showing that the defendant:  
|  (1) is too poor to pay the fine and costs; or  
|  (2) has remained in jail a sufficient length of time to  
| satisfy the fine and costs, at the rate of not less than _$200_ [ ~~$100~~ ]  
| for each period served, as specified by the convicting court in the  
| judgment in the case.  
|  (b) A convicting court may specify a period that is not less  
| than eight hours or more than 24 hours as the period for which a  
| defendant who fails to pay the fine and costs in the case must  
| remain in jail to satisfy _$200_ [ ~~$100~~ ] of the fine and costs.  
|  SECTION 3. (a)  The change in law made by this Act to Article  
| 43.09(a), Code of Criminal Procedure, applies only to a defendant  
| convicted of a misdemeanor on or after the effective date of this  
| Act, regardless of whether the misdemeanor was committed before,  
| on, or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  (b) The change in law made by this Act to Article 45.048,  
| Code of Criminal Procedure, applies to a defendant who is placed in  
| jail on or after the effective date of this Act for failure to pay  
| the fine and costs imposed on conviction of an offense, regardless  
| of whether the offense for which the defendant was convicted was  
| committed before, on, or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

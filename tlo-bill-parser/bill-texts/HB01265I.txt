|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the transfer of a limitation established by a county,  
| municipality, or junior college district on the amount of ad  
| valorem taxes imposed on the residence homestead of an elderly or  
| disabled person.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 11.261(g) and (h), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (g) Except as provided by Subsection (c), if an individual  
| who receives a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college  
| district tax increases provided by this section subsequently  
| qualifies _for an exemption under Section 11.13_ a different  
| residence homestead in the same county, municipality, or junior  
| college district _or in a different county, municipality, or junior_  
| _college district that has established a limitation on tax increases_  
| _provided by this section_ [ ~~for an exemption under Section 11.13~~ ],  
| the county, _if the individual received the limitation applicable to_  
| _the former homestead from a county, the_ municipality, _if the_  
| _individual received the limitation applicable to the former_  
| _homestead from a municipality,_ or _the_ junior college district _, if_  
| _the individual received the limitation applicable to the former_  
| _homestead from a junior college district,_ may not impose ad valorem  
| taxes on the subsequently qualified homestead in a year in an amount  
| that exceeds the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or  
| junior college district would have imposed on the subsequently  
| qualified homestead in the first year in which the individual  
| receives that exemption for the subsequently qualified homestead  
| had the limitation on tax increases provided by this section not  
| been in effect, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is  
| the total amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior  
| college district _, as applicable,_ imposed on the former homestead in  
| the last year in which the individual received that exemption for  
| the former homestead and the denominator of which is the total  
| amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college  
| district _, as applicable,_ would have imposed on the former homestead  
| in the last year in which the individual received that exemption for  
| the former homestead had the limitation on tax increases provided  
| by this section not been in effect.  
|  (h) An individual who receives a limitation on county,  
| municipal, or junior college district tax increases under this  
| section and who subsequently qualifies _for an exemption under_  
| _Section 11.13_ a different residence homestead in the same county,  
| municipality, or junior college district _or in a different county,_  
| _municipality, or junior college district that has established a_  
| _limitation on tax increases provided by this section_ [ ~~for an~~  
|  ~~exemption under Section 11.13~~ ], or an agent of the individual, is  
| entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the appraisal  
| district in which the former homestead was located a written  
| certificate providing the information necessary to determine  
| whether the individual may qualify for a limitation on the  
| subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to  
| calculate the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior  
| college district may impose on the subsequently qualified  
| homestead.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to an ad valorem tax year  
| that begins on or after January 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| the transfer of a limitation established by a county, city or town,  
| or junior college district on the amount of ad valorem taxes imposed  
| on the residence homestead of an elderly or disabled person is  
| approved by the voters. If that amendment is not approved by the  
| voters, this Act has no effect.

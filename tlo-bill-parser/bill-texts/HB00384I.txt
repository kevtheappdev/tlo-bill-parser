| follows:  
|  (i) The assessor and collector for a taxing unit may  
| disregard the exemptions authorized by Subsection (b), (c), (d),  
| [ ~~or~~ ] (n) _, (s), or (t)_ [ ~~of this section~~ ] and assess and
collect a tax  
| pledged for payment of debt without deducting the amount of the  
| exemption if:  
|  (1) prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit  
| pledged the taxes for the payment of a debt; and  
|  (2) granting the exemption would impair the obligation  
| of the contract creating the debt.  
|  _(s)_ _____In addition to any other exemptions provided by this_  
| _section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation of_  
| _the total appraised value of the individual's residence homestead_  
| _if:_  
|  _(1) the individual is 80 years of age or older; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the individual has received an exemption under_  
| _this section for the residence homestead for at least the preceding_  
| _10 years._  
|  _(t)_ _____The surviving spouse of an individual who qualified for_  
| _an exemption under Subsection (s) is entitled to an exemption from_  
| _taxation of the total appraised value of the same property to which_  
| _the deceased spouse's exemption applied if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the deceased spouse died in a year in which the_  
| _deceased spouse qualified for the exemption;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the surviving spouse was 55 years of age or older_  
| _when the deceased spouse died; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the property was the residence homestead of the_  
| _surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the_  
| _residence homestead of the surviving spouse._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 11.42(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) An exemption authorized by Section 11.13(c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d),  
| _or (s),_ 11.132, 11.133, or 11.134 is effective as of January 1 of  
| the tax year in which the person qualifies for the exemption and  
| applies to the entire tax year.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 11.43(k), (l), (m), (o), and (q), Tax  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (k) A person who qualifies for an exemption authorized by  
| Section 11.13(c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d) _, or (s)_ or 11.132 must apply for the  
| exemption no later than the first anniversary of the date the person  
| qualified for the exemption.  
|  (l) The form for an application under Section 11.13 must  
| include a space for the applicant to state the applicant's date of  
| birth. Failure to provide the date of birth does not affect the  
| applicant's eligibility for an exemption under that section, other  
| than an exemption under Section 11.13(c) or (d) for an individual 65  
| years of age or older _or an exemption under Section 11.13(s) for an_  
| _individual 80 years of age or older_.  
|  (m) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (k), a person who  
| receives an exemption under Section 11.13, other than an exemption  
| under Section 11.13(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or  
| older _or an exemption under Section 11.13(s) for an individual 80_  
| _years of age or older_ , in a tax year is entitled to receive an  
| exemption under Section 11.13(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years  
| of age or older _or an exemption under Section 11.13(s) for an_  
| _individual 80 years of age or older_ in the next tax year on the same  
| property without applying for the exemption if the person becomes  
| 65 _or 80_ years of age _, as applicable,_ in that next year as shown by:  
|  (1) information in the records of the appraisal  
| district that was provided to the appraisal district by the  
| individual in an application for an exemption under Section 11.13  
| on the property or in correspondence relating to the property; or  
|  (2) the information provided by the Texas Department  
| of Public Safety to the appraisal district under Section 521.049,  
| Transportation Code.  
|  (o) The application form for an exemption authorized by  
| Section 11.13 must require an applicant for an exemption under  
| Subsection (c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d) _, or (s)_ of that section who is not  
| specifically identified on a deed or other appropriate instrument  
| recorded in the applicable real property records as an owner of the  
| residence homestead to provide an affidavit or other compelling  
| evidence establishing the applicant's ownership of an interest in  
| the homestead.  
|  (q) A chief appraiser may not cancel an exemption under  
| Section 11.13 that is received by an individual who is 65 years of  
| age or older without first providing written notice of the  
| cancellation to the individual receiving the exemption. The notice  
| must include a form on which the individual may indicate whether the  
| individual is qualified to receive the exemption and a  
| self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for  
| returning the form to the chief appraiser. The chief appraiser  
| shall consider the individual's response on the form in determining  
| whether to continue to allow the exemption. If the chief appraiser  
| does not receive a response on or before the 60th day after the date  
| the notice is mailed, the chief appraiser may cancel the exemption  
| on or after the 30th day after the expiration of the 60-day period,  
| but only after making a reasonable effort to locate the individual  
| and determine whether the individual is qualified to receive the  
| exemption. For purposes of this subsection, sending an additional  
| notice of cancellation that includes, in bold font equal to or  
| greater in size than the surrounding text, the date on which the  
| chief appraiser is authorized to cancel the exemption to the  
| individual receiving the exemption immediately after the  
| expiration of the 60-day period by first class mail in an envelope  
| on which is written, in all capital letters, "RETURN SERVICE  
| REQUESTED," or another appropriate statement directing the United  
| States Postal Service to return the notice if it is not deliverable  
| as addressed, or providing the additional notice in another manner  
| that the chief appraiser determines is appropriate, constitutes a  
| reasonable effort on the part of the chief appraiser. This  
| subsection does not apply to an exemption under Section 11.13(c) or  
| (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older _or an exemption under_  
| _Section 11.13(s) for an individual 80 years of age or older_ that is  
| canceled because the chief appraiser determines that the individual  
| receiving the exemption no longer owns the property subject to the  
| exemption.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 26.10(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead  
| exemption under Section 11.13(c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d), _or (s),_ 11.132,
11.133,  
| or 11.134 applicable to a property on January 1 of a year terminated  
| during the year and if the owner of the property qualifies a  
| different property for one of those residence homestead exemptions  
| during the same year, the tax due against the former residence  
| homestead is calculated by:  
|  (1) subtracting:  
|  (A) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner qualified for the residence homestead exemption for the  
| entire year; from  
|  (B) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner not qualified for the residence homestead exemption  
| during the year;  
|  (2) multiplying the remainder determined under  
| Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and  
| the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the  
| date the exemption terminated; and  
|  (3) adding the product determined under Subdivision  
| (2) and the amount described by Subdivision (1)(A).  
|  SECTION 5. Section 26.112, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 26.112. CALCULATION OF TAXES ON RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD OF  
| CERTAIN PERSONS. (a) Except as provided by Section 26.10(b), if  
| at any time during a tax year property is owned by an individual who  
| qualifies for an exemption under Section 11.13(c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d), _or_  
| _(s),_ 11.133, or 11.134, the amount of the tax due on the property  
| for the tax year is calculated as if the individual qualified for  
| the exemption on January 1 and continued to qualify for the  
| exemption for the remainder of the tax year.  
|  (b) If an individual qualifies for an exemption under  
| Section 11.13(c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d), _or (s),_ 11.133, or 11.134 with
respect  
| to the property after the amount of the tax due on the property is  
| calculated and the effect of the qualification is to reduce the  
| amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor for each taxing  
| unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on the property and  
| correct the tax roll. If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on  
| the property has not been paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected  
| tax bill to the person in whose name the property is listed on the  
| tax roll or to the person's authorized agent. If the tax on the  
| property has been paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall  
| refund to the person who paid the tax the amount by which the  
| payment exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 33.01(d), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d) In lieu of the penalty imposed under Subsection (a), a  
| delinquent tax incurs a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the  
| tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been  
| delinquent if the tax is delinquent because the property owner  
| received an exemption under:  
|  (1) Section 11.13 and the chief appraiser subsequently  
| cancels the exemption because the residence was not the principal  
| residence of the property owner and the property owner received an  
| exemption for two or more additional residence homesteads for the  
| tax year in which the tax was imposed;  
|  (2) Section 11.13(c) or (d) for a person who is 65  
| years of age or older and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels  
| the exemption because the property owner was younger than 65 years  
| of age; [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (3) _Section 11.13(s) for a person who is 80 years of_  
| _age or older and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the_  
| _exemption because the property owner was younger than 80 years of_  
| _age; or_  
|  _(4)_ Section 11.13(q) _or (t)_ and the chief appraiser  
| subsequently cancels the exemption because the property owner was  
| younger than 55 years of age when the property owner's spouse died.

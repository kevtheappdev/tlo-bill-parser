|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the eligibility of land used as an ecological  
| laboratory for appraisal for ad valorem tax purposes as qualified  
| open-space land.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.51(1), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (1) "Qualified open-space land" means land that is  
| currently devoted principally to agricultural use to the degree of  
| intensity generally accepted in the area and that has been devoted  
| principally to agricultural use or to production of timber or  
| forest products for five of the preceding seven years or land that  
| is used principally as an ecological laboratory by a public or  
| private college or university _and that has been used principally in_  
| _that manner by the college or university for five of the preceding_  
| _seven years_.  Qualified open-space land includes all appurtenances  
| to the land.  For the purposes of this subdivision, appurtenances to  
| the land means private roads, dams, reservoirs, water wells,  
| canals, ditches, terraces, and other reshapings of the soil,  
| fences, and riparian water rights. Notwithstanding the other  
| provisions of this subdivision, land that is currently devoted  
| principally to wildlife management as defined by Subdivision (7)(B)  
| or (C) to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area  
| qualifies for appraisal as qualified open-space land under this  
| subchapter regardless of the manner in which the land was used in  
| any preceding year.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to the appraisal of land  
| for ad valorem tax purposes for a tax year that begins on or after  
| the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

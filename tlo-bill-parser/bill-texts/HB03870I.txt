|  _Sec. 171.701. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Qualified entity" means a taxable entity that_  
| _pays ad valorem taxes on qualified inventory owned by the entity and_  
| _located in this state._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Qualified inventory" means tangible personal_  
| _property held for sale at retail other than:_  
|  _(A)_ _____a dealer's motor vehicle inventory as defined_

|  _Sec._ ___171.703._ _____AMOUNT OF CREDIT; LIMITATIONS._ ___(a)_ ___The
total_  
| _amount of the credit under this subchapter is equal to the amount of_  
| _the ad valorem taxes paid by the qualified entity during the period_

| _of qualified inventory owned by the entity and located in this_  
| _state._

| _of the credit to another entity._ ___There is no limit on the total_  
| _number of transactions for the sale or assignment of all or part of_  
| _the total credit authorized under this subchapter, however,_

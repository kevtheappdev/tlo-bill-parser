|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the right to vacate and avoid liability under a  
| residential lease after a tenant's death.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter A, Chapter 92, Property Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 92.0162 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___92.0162._ _____RIGHT TO VACATE AND AVOID LIABILITY FOLLOWING_  
| _TENANT'S DEATH. (a) The estate or a family member of a tenant who_  
| _dies before the expiration of the tenant's lease may terminate the_  
| _tenant's rights and obligations under the lease and may vacate the_  
| _dwelling and avoid liability for future rent and any other sums due_  
| _under the lease for terminating the lease and vacating the dwelling_  
| _before the end of the lease term after the estate or the family_  
| _member of the deceased tenant complies with Subsection (b)._  
|  _(b)_ _____The estate or a family member of the deceased tenant_  
| _exercising the rights under Subsection (a) must:_  
|  _(1) provide to the landlord timely notice:_  
|  _(A)_ _____informing the landlord of the tenant's death;_  
| _and_  
|  _(B)_ _____identifying the representative of the estate_  
| _or family member of the deceased tenant acting as authorized under_  
| _this section;_  
|  _(2)_ _____remove the deceased tenant's property and_  
| _otherwise vacate the premises on or before the next date on which_  
| _rent would be due under the lease; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____otherwise comply with the terms of the lease,_  
| _including:_  
|  _(A)_ _____paying delinquent rent payments and other_  
| _delinquent amounts due under the lease; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____repairing any damage to the premises unless_  
| _the condition was caused by normal wear and tear._  
|  _(c)_ _____On receipt of the notice provided under Subsection (b),_  
| _the landlord shall provide a copy of the written lease agreement to_  
| _the person identified in the notice._  
|  _(d)_ _____If the representative of the tenant's estate or the_  
| _tenant's family member fails to vacate the premises or to otherwise_  
| _comply with the lease agreement as provided by Subsection (b), the_  
| _tenant's estate:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is liable for rent payments for any period during_  
| _which the premises remain occupied; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____may be subject to any other penalty imposed by the_  
| _lease._  
|  _(e)_ _____A landlord may not impose any penalty, including an_  
| _early move-out or reletting charge, for the sole reason that the_  
| _lease was terminated because of a tenant's death. A lease provision_  
| _that imposes a penalty under the circumstances described by this_  
| _subsection is void._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 92.0162, Property Code, as added by this  
| Act, applies only to a lease agreement entered into on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A lease agreement entered into before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect at  
| the time the lease agreement was entered into, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

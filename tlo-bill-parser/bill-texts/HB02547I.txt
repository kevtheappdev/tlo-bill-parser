| supreme court, on a form prescribed by the chief justice, that:

| reprimanded or censured by the State Commission on Judicial  
| Conduct; and  
|  (B) the justice or judge:  
|  (i) did not resign or retire from office  
| after the State Commission on Judicial Conduct notified the justice  
| or judge of the commencement of a full investigation into an  
| allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability of the justice  
| or judge as provided in Section 33.022 and before the final  
| disposition of that investigation; or

|  (c) An active _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] retired _, or former_ justice or judge  
| assigned as provided by this section out of the county of _the_

| list of retired and former _justices and_ judges who meet the  
| requirements of this section.  
|  (b) The presiding judge shall divide the list into area  
| specialties of criminal, civil, or domestic relations cases. A  
| retired or former _justice or_ judge may only be assigned to a case in

| qualify for assignment in more than one area of specialty.  
|  (c) To be eligible to be named on the list, a retired or  
| former _justice or_ judge must:

| Conduct; and  
|  (B) the _justice or_ judge:  
|  (i) did not resign or retire from office  
| after the State Commission on Judicial Conduct notified the _justice_  
| _or_ judge of the commencement of a full investigation into an  
| allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability of the _justice_

| disposition of that investigation; or  
|  (ii) if the _justice or_ judge _resigned_ [ ~~did~~

| requirements for active district, statutory probate, and statutory  
| county court judges; and  
|  (6) certify to the presiding judge a willingness not  
| to appear and plead as an attorney in any court in this state _in_  
| _which the justice or judge served as a justice or judge_ for a period  
| of two years _following that service_.  
|  (e) For purposes of Subsection (c)(1), a month of service is

| which a _justice or_ judge was authorized by election or appointment  
| to preside.  
|  (f) A former or retired _justice or_ judge is ineligible to be  
| named on the list if the former or retired _justice or_ judge is

| remain on the list.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a certification or recertification that takes effect after the  
| effective date of this Act.  A certification or recertification  
| that takes effect before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the certification or  
| recertification took effect, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

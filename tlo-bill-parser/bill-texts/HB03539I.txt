|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the appointment of a local public defender's office to  
| represent indigent defendants in criminal cases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 26.04, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (a) and (f) to read as follows:  
|  (a) The judges of the county courts, statutory county  
| courts, and district courts trying criminal cases in each county,  
| by local rule, shall adopt and publish written countywide  
| procedures for timely and fairly appointing counsel for an indigent  
| defendant in the county arrested for, charged with, or taking an  
| appeal from a conviction of a misdemeanor punishable by confinement  
| or a felony. The procedures must be consistent with this article  
| and Articles 1.051, 15.17, 15.18, 26.05, and 26.052 _and must_  
| _provide for the priority appointment of a public defender's office_  
| _as described by Subsection (f)_. A court shall appoint an attorney  
| from a public appointment list using a system of rotation, unless  
| the court appoints an attorney under Subsection (f), (f-1), (h), or  
| (i). The court shall appoint attorneys from among the next five  
| names on the appointment list in the order in which the attorneys'  
| names appear on the list, unless the court makes a finding of good  
| cause on the record for appointing an attorney out of order. An  
| attorney who is not appointed in the order in which the attorney's  
| name appears on the list shall remain next in order on the list.  
|  (f) In a county _with_ [ ~~in which~~ ] a public defender's office  
| [ ~~is created or designated under Article 26.044~~ ], the court or the  
| courts' designee shall give priority in appointing that office to  
| represent the defendant _in the criminal proceeding, including a_  
| _proceeding in a capital murder case_.  However, the court is not  
| required to appoint the public defender's office if:  
|  (1) the court _makes a finding of good cause on the_  
| _record for appointing_ [ ~~has reason to appoint~~ ] other counsel; [
~~or~~ ]  
|  (2) _the appointment would be contrary to the office's_  
| _written plan under Article 26.044;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the office is prohibited from accepting the_  
| _appointment under Article 26.044(j); or_  
|  _(4)_ a managed assigned counsel program also exists in  
| the county and an attorney will be appointed under that program.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

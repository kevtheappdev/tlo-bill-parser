| emergency care provider, and the insurer or administrator, as  
| applicable, as to the amount paid by the insurer or administrator to  
| the _laboratory,_ facility-based provider _,_ or emergency care

|  Sec. 1467.059. MEDIATION AGREEMENT. The mediator shall

| regulatory agency, as appropriate, shall adopt rules regulating the  
| investigation and review of a complaint filed that relates to the  
| settlement of an out-of-network health benefit claim that is  
| subject to this chapter. The rules adopted under this section  
| must:  
|  (1) distinguish among complaints for out-of-network  
| coverage or payment and give priority to investigating allegations  
| of delayed health care _services_ [ ~~or medical care~~ ];  
|  (2) develop a form for filing a complaint and  
| establish an outreach effort to inform enrollees of the  
| availability of the claims dispute resolution process under this  
| chapter;

| appropriate consideration;

| complaint, including:  
|  (A) the type of services that gave rise to the  
| dispute;  
|  (B) the type and specialty, if any, of the  
| _laboratory,_ facility-based provider _,_ or emergency care provider  
| who provided the out-of-network service;  
|  (C) the county and metropolitan area in which the  
| health care [ ~~or medical~~ ] service [ ~~or supply~~ ] was provided;  
|  (D) whether the health care [ ~~or medical~~ ] service  
| [ ~~or supply~~ ] was for emergency care; and  
|  (E) any other information about:  
|  (i) the insurer or administrator that the  
| commissioner by rule requires; or  
|  (ii) the _laboratory,_ facility-based  
| provider _,_ or emergency care provider that the Texas Medical Board  
| or other appropriate regulatory agency by rule requires.  
|  (d) A _laboratory,_ facility-based provider _,_ or emergency  
| care provider who fails to provide a disclosure under Section  
| 1467.051 or 1467.0511 is not subject to discipline by the Texas  
| Medical Board or other appropriate regulatory agency for that  
| failure and a cause of action is not created by a failure to  
| disclose as required by Section 1467.051 or 1467.0511.  
|  SECTION 13. The changes in law made by this Act apply only  
| to a claim for health care services provided on or after January 1,  
| 2020\. A claim for health care services provided before January 1,  
| 2020, is governed by the law as it existed immediately before the  
| effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 14. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

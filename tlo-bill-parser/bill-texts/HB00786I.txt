| _contribution to:_  
|  _(1) a statewide officeholder other than the governor;_  
|  _(2) a member of the legislature; or_

|  _(a-2)_ _____During the period beginning on the date the governor_  
| _issues a proclamation calling a special legislative session and_  
| _continuing through the 20th day after the date of final adjournment_  
| _of the special legislative session, a person may not knowingly make_  
| _a political contribution to the governor or a specific-purpose_  
| _committee for supporting, opposing, or assisting the governor._  
|  (b) A statewide officeholder, a member of the legislature,  
| or a specific-purpose committee for supporting, opposing, or  
| assisting a statewide officeholder or member of the legislature may  
| not knowingly accept a political contribution, and shall refuse a  
| political contribution that is received, during _an applicable_ [ ~~the~~ ]

| contribution that is received and refused during that period shall  
| be returned to the contributor not later than the 30th day after the  
| date of receipt. A contribution made by United States mail or by  
| common or contract carrier is not considered received during that  
| period if it was properly addressed and placed with postage or  
| carrier charges prepaid or prearranged in the mail or delivered to  
| the contract carrier before the beginning of the period. The date  
| indicated by the post office cancellation mark or the common or

| that was made and accepted with the intent that it be used:  
|  (1) in an election held or ordered during _a_ [ ~~the~~ ]  
| period prescribed by Subsection (a) _, (a-1), or (a-2)_ in which the  
| person accepting the contribution is a candidate if the  
| contribution was made after the person appointed a campaign  
| treasurer with the appropriate authority and before the person was  
| sworn in for that office;  
|  (2) to defray expenses incurred in connection with an  
| election contest; or  
|  (3) by a person who holds a state office or a member of  
| the legislature if the person or member was defeated at the general  
| election held immediately before the session is convened or by a  
| specific-purpose political committee that supports or assists only  
| that person or member.  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a political contribution made on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  A political contribution made before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the  
| contribution was made, and the former law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

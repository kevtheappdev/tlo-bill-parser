|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) The Health and Human Services Commission  
| shall conduct a study examining the interest or other waiting lists  
| maintained for the following Medicaid programs authorized under  
| Section 1915(c) of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  
| Section 1396n(c)) that provide services to persons with  
| intellectual and developmental disabilities:  
|  (1) the community living assistance and support  
| services (CLASS) waiver program;

| program;  
|  (3) the deaf-blind with multiple disabilities (DBMD)  
| waiver program; and

|  (b) In conducting the study under this section, the Health  
| and Human Services Commission shall:  
|  (1) consider and analyze the effect implementation of  
| a managed care delivery system under Medicaid had on the interest or  
| other waiting lists, taking into account the experiences of other  
| states that have implemented similar delivery systems; and  
|  (2) identify:

| employ to eliminate the interest or other waiting lists, including  
| strategies employed by other states and strategies through which  
| this state could receive additional federal funding; and  
|  (B) a date by which the commission believes it  
| could eliminate the interest or other waiting lists if the  
| identified strategies were implemented.  
|  (c) Not later than September 1, 2020, the Health and Human  
| Services Commission shall submit to the legislature a written

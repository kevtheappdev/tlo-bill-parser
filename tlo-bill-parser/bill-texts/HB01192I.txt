| comptroller shall deposit fees imposed under Section 151.059, Tax  
| Code, in the state treasury and shall keep records of the amount of  
| money collected for each reporting period. Such fees shall be held  
| in trust in the suspense account of each eligible taxing unit. The  
| comptroller shall distribute money in the suspense accounts under  
| this section to each eligible taxing unit in the amount and manner  
| provided by federal law or this section.  
|  (b) A local taxing unit is eligible to receive funds under  
| this section if it has adopted a sales and use tax under Chapter  
| 321, Chapter 322, or Chapter 323, Tax Code, or has adopted a local  
| sales and use tax governed in part by any provision of those  
| chapters.  
|  (c) The comptroller shall transmit to each eligible taxing  
| unit's treasurer, or to the officer performing the functions of  
| that office, on a quarterly basis, the taxing unit's share of the  
| fees remitted to the comptroller, together with the pro rata share  
| of any penalty or interest on delinquent fees that may be collected.  
| Before transmitting the funds, the comptroller shall deduct _one_

| in the state treasury under this section shall be credited to the

| comptroller shall compute for each calendar quarter the percentage  
| of total sales and use tax allocations made pursuant to Title 3 of  
| the Tax Code, including any local sales and use taxes governed by  
| any provision of Title 3 of the Tax Code, to each eligible taxing  
| unit and shall apply that percentage to the total fees collected  
| under Section 151.059, Tax Code, and allocated to eligible taxing  
| units in that quarter.  
|  (f) The comptroller may combine an eligible taxing unit's  
| share of the fees remitted or collected under Section 151.059, Tax  
| Code, a suspense account under this section, or an allocation made  
| under this section with other trust or suspense accounts held for  
| that taxing unit or other allocations made to that taxing unit under

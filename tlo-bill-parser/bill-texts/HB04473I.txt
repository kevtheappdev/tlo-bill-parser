|  _(A) the names of the two resulting districts;_  
|  _(B) the services to be provided by each district;_  
|  _(C)_ _____the proposed date on which the original_  
| _district will cease to provide one service and the newly created_  
| _district will begin to provide that service; and_  
|  _(D)_ _____a statement that the original district will_  
| _be separated into two completely overlapping districts only if a_  
| _majority of the residents of the original district approve the_  
| _separation in an election held for that purpose._  
|  _(a-1)_ _____Subject to Section 4.003, Election Code, the notice of_

| _the initial board of the newly created district. The appointed_  
| _commissioners will serve until December 31 of the year the new_  
| _district is created. The commissioners court shall then appoint_  
| _commissioners for a full term under Section 775.034 or 775.0341, as_  
| _applicable._  
|  _(f)_ _____For a newly created district to which Section 775.0345_

| _appoint the initial board of the newly created district._ ___The_  
| _appointed commissioners will serve until the next election date of_  
| _the commissioners of the original district._ ___The board of the_  
| _original district shall hold an election for both the board of the_  
| _original district and the board of the new district on the election_  
| _date of the original district's commissioners according to the_  
| _requirements of Section 775.0345 or 775.035, as applicable. The_  
| _five commissioner positions on each board shall be filled at the_  
| _election held by the original district. For each board, the three_

| _will serve two-year terms. After the initial election, each_  
| _district shall separately hold an election on the dates and in the_  
| _manner described by Section 775.0345 or 775.035, as applicable._  
|  _(g)_ _____Within two years after the election held to separate the_  
| _district under this section, the boards of the two districts may_  
| _transfer any real or personal property or any indebtedness between_  
| _the districts to promote the delivery of services provided by each_  
| _district._  
|  _(h)_ _____If any bonded debt was held by the original district_  
| _before the election held under this section, the newly created_  
| _district shall annually pay to the original district an amount_  
| _equal to one-half of the original district's annual debt_  
| _obligations._  
|  _(i)_ _____Districts resulting from a separation under this_  
| _section shall comply with Section 775.020 or 775.0205, as_

| _year, the rates shall be calculated based on the_  
| _tax rate adopted in_  
| _the prior year by the board of each district according to the_

|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| _modifying the community supervision of a defendant who commits a_  
| _technical violation as provided by Article 42A.7555, Code of_  
| _Criminal Procedure, instead of revoking the defendant's community_  
| _supervision; and_  
|  _(2) provide:_  
|  _(A)_ _____one-third of the cost savings described by_  
| _Subdivision (1) to the division to be allocated to individual_

| added by this Act, applies to a person on community supervision on  
| or after the effective date of this Act, regardless of whether the

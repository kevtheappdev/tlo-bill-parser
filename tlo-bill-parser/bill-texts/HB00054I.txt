|  SECTION 18. Section 5.041, Tax Code, as amended by this Act,  
| applies only to an appraisal review board member appointed to serve  
| a term of office that begins on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.

| under a requirement of that section until the form and instructions  
| are prepared and made available by the comptroller.  
|  SECTION 21. Section 6.412, Tax Code, as amended by this Act,

|  SECTION 25. The changes in law made by this Act in the  
| qualifications of persons serving as arbitrators in binding

| affect the entitlement of a person serving as an arbitrator  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act to continue to  
| serve as an arbitrator and to conduct hearings on arbitrations  
| until the person is required to renew the person's agreement with  
| the comptroller to serve as an arbitrator. The changes in law apply

| Act does not prohibit a person who is serving as an arbitrator on  
| the effective date of this Act from renewing the person's agreement  
| with the comptroller to serve as an arbitrator if the person has the  
| qualifications required for an arbitrator under the Tax Code as  
| amended by this Act.  
|  SECTION 26. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

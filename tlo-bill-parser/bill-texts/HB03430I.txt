|  AN ACT  
| relating to the transfer of a retired county law enforcement dog.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 263.152(a), Local Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commissioners court of a county may:  
|  (1) periodically sell the county's surplus or salvage  
| property by competitive bid or auction, except that competitive  
| bidding or an auction is not necessary if the purchaser is another  
| county or a political subdivision within the county that is selling  
| the surplus or salvage property;  
|  (2) offer the property as a trade-in for new property  
| of the same general type if the commissioners court considers that  
| action to be in the best interests of the county;  
|  (3) order any of the property to be destroyed or  
| otherwise disposed of as worthless if the commissioners court  
| undertakes to sell that property under Subdivision (1) and is  
| unable to do so because no bids are made;  
|  (4) dispose of the property by donating it to a civic  
| or charitable organization located in the county if the  
| commissioners court determines that:  
|  (A) undertaking to sell the property under  
| Subdivision (1) would likely result in no bids or a bid price that  
| is less than the county's expenses required for the bid process;  
|  (B) the donation serves a public purpose; and  
|  (C) the organization will provide the county with  
| adequate consideration, such as relieving the county of  
| transportation or disposal expenses related to the property;  
|  (5) transfer gambling equipment in the possession of  
| the county following its forfeiture to the state to the Texas

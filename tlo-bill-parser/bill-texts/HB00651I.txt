| _SUBCHAPTER D. MANDATORY PAYMENTS_  
|  _Sec._ ___299.0151._ _____MANDATORY PAYMENTS. (a) Except as provided_  
| _by Subsection (e), if the commissioners court of a county_  
| _authorizes a health care provider participation program under this_  
| _chapter, the commissioners court shall require an annual mandatory_  
| _payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each_  
| _institutional health care provider located in the county._ ___The_  
| _commissioners court shall provide that the mandatory payment is to_  
| _be collected at least annually, but not more often than quarterly._ __  
| _In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the_  
| _mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an_  
| _institutional health care provider located in the county as_  
| _determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health_  
| _Services under Sections 311.032 and 311.033 in the most recent_  
| _fiscal year for which that data was reported. If the institutional_  
| _health care provider did not report any data under those sections,_  
| _the provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as_  
| _contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the_  
| _previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for_  
| _which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report._ ___The county_  
| _shall update the amount of the mandatory payment on an annual basis._  
|  _(b)_ _____The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this_  
| _chapter for a county must be uniformly proportionate with the_  
| _amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying hospital in_  
| _the county. A mandatory payment authorized under this chapter may_  
| _not hold harmless any institutional health care provider, as_  
| _required under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w)._  
|  _(c)_ _____The commissioners court of a county that authorizes a_  
| _program under this chapter shall set the amount of the mandatory_  
| _payment. The amount of the mandatory payment required of each_  
| _paying hospital in the county may not exceed six percent of the_  
| _hospital's net patient revenue._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subject to the maximum amount prescribed by Subsection_  
| _(c), the commissioners court of a county that authorizes a program_  
| _shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate_  
| _will generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative_  
| _expenses of the county for activities under this chapter, fund an_  
| _intergovernmental transfer described by Section 299.0103(b)(1), or_  
| _make other payments authorized under this chapter. The amount of_  
| _revenue from mandatory payments that may be used for administrative_  
| _expenses by the county in a year may not exceed $25,000, plus the_  
| _cost of collateralization of deposits. If the commissioners court_  
| _demonstrates to the paying hospitals in the county that the costs of_  
| _administering the health care provider participation program under_  
| _this chapter, excluding those costs associated with the_  
| _collateralization of deposits, exceed $25,000 in any year, on_  
| _consent of all of the paying hospitals in the county, the county may_  
| _use additional revenue from mandatory payments received under this_  
| _chapter to compensate the county for its administrative expenses. A_  
| _paying hospital may not unreasonably withhold consent to compensate_  
| _the county for administrative expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _____A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient or insurer._  
|  _(f)_ _____A mandatory payment under this chapter is not a tax for_  
| _purposes of Section 5(a), Article IX, Texas Constitution._  
|  _Sec._ ___299.0152._ _____ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF MANDATORY_  
| _PAYMENTS. A county may collect or contract for the assessment and_  
| _collection of mandatory payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___299.0153._ _____CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE. To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the county may provide by_  
| _rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the_  
| _requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services. A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose,_  
| _or materially expand the legal or financial liability or_  
| _responsibility of the county or an institutional health care_  
| _provider in the county beyond the provisions of this chapter. This_  
| _section does not require the commissioners court of a county to_  
| _adopt a rule._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

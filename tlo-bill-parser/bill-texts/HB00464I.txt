|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to an application for a writ of habeas corpus based on  
| certain relevant scientific evidence that was not available at the  
| applicant's trial.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 11.073(b), Code of Criminal Procedure,  
| is amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A court may grant a convicted person relief on an  
| application for a writ of habeas corpus if:  
|  (1) the convicted person files an application, in the  
| manner provided by Article 11.07, 11.071, or 11.072, containing  
| specific facts indicating that:  
|  (A) relevant scientific evidence is currently  
| available and was not available at the time of the convicted  
| person's trial because the evidence was not ascertainable through  
| the exercise of reasonable diligence by the convicted person before  
| the date of or during the convicted person's trial; and  
|  (B) the scientific evidence would be admissible  
| under the Texas Rules of Evidence at a trial held on the date of the  
| application; and  
|  (2) the court makes the findings described by  
| Subdivisions (1)(A) and (B) and also finds that, had the scientific  
| evidence been presented at trial, on the preponderance of the  
| evidence the person would not have been convicted _or would have_  
| _received a different punishment_.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 11.073, Code of Criminal Procedure, as  
| amended by this Act, applies only to an application for a writ of  
| habeas corpus filed on or after the effective date of this Act. An  
| application filed before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect when the application was filed, and the former  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect December 1, 2019.

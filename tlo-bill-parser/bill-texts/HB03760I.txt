|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the disposition of surplus vehicles by a governmental  
| agency.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 503.063, Transportation Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 503.063. BUYER'S TEMPORARY TAGS. (a) Except as  
| provided by this section, a dealer _or federal, state, or local_  
| _governmental agency exempt from the requirements to obtain a dealer_  
| _general distinguishing number under Section 503.024(a)(2)_ shall  
| issue to a person who buys a vehicle one temporary buyer's tag for  
| the vehicle.  
|  (b) Except as provided by this section, the buyer's tag is  
| valid for the operation of the vehicle until the earlier of:  
|  (1) the date on which the vehicle is registered; or  
|  (2) the 60th day after the date of purchase.  
|  (c) The dealer _or federal, state, or local governmental_  
| _agency_ :  
|  (1) must show in ink on the buyer's tag the actual date  
| of sale and any other required information; and  
|  (2) is responsible for displaying the tag.  
|  (d) The dealer _or federal, state, or local governmental_  
| _agency_ is responsible for the safekeeping and distribution of each  
| buyer's tag the dealer _or federal, state, or local governmental_  
| _agency_ obtains.  
|  (e) The department may not issue a buyer's tag or contract  
| for the issuance of a buyer's tag but shall prescribe:  
|  (1) the specifications, color, and form of a buyer's  
| tag; and  
|  (2) procedures for a dealer _or federal, state, or_  
| _local governmental agency_ to:  
|  (A) generate a vehicle-specific number using the  
| database developed under Section 503.0631 and assign it to each  
| tag;  
|  (B) generate a vehicle-specific number using the  
| database developed under Section 503.0631 for future use for when a  
| dealer _or federal, state, or local governmental agency_ is unable to  
| access the Internet at the time of sale; and  
|  (C) clearly display the vehicle-specific number  
| on the tag.  
|  (f) The department shall ensure that a dealer _or federal,_  
| _state, or local governmental agency_ may generate in advance a  
| sufficient amount of vehicle-specific numbers under Subsection  
| (e)(2)(B) in order to continue selling vehicles for a period of up  
| to one week in which a dealer _or federal, state, or local_  
| _governmental agency_ is unable to access the Internet due to an  
| emergency. The department shall establish an expedited procedure  
| to allow affected dealers _or federal, state, or local governmental_  
| _agency_ to apply for additional vehicle-specific numbers so they may  
| remain in business during an emergency.  
|  (g) For each buyer's temporary tag, a dealer shall charge  
| the buyer a registration fee of not more than $5 as prescribed by  
| the department to be sent to the comptroller for deposit to the  
| credit of the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles fund. _A federal,_  
| _state, or local governmental agency is not required to charge the_  
| _fee prescribed under this Subsection._

|  (c) Except as provided by Subsection (d), before a buyer's  
| temporary tag may be displayed on a vehicle, a dealer _or federal,_  
| _state, or local governmental agency_ must enter into the database  
| through the Internet information about the buyer of the vehicle for  
| which the tag was issued as prescribed by the department and  
| generate a vehicle-specific number for the tag as required by  
| Section 503.063(e). The department may not deny access to the  
| database to any dealer who holds a general distinguishing number  
| issued under this chapter or who is licensed under Chapter 2301,  
| Occupations Code.  
|  (d) A dealer _or federal, state, or local governmental agency_  
| shall obtain 24-hour Internet access at its place of business _or_

| _governmental agency_ is unable to access the Internet at the time of  
| the sale of a vehicle, the dealer _or federal, state, or local_  
| _governmental agency_ shall complete and sign a form, as prescribed  
| by the department, that states the dealer _or federal, state, or_  
| _local governmental agency_ has Internet access, but was unable to  
| access the Internet at the time of sale. The buyer shall keep the  
| original copy of the form in the vehicle until the vehicle is  
| registered to the buyer.  
| Not later than the next business day after  
| the time of sale, the dealer _or federal, state, or local_  
| _governmental agency_ shall submit the information required under

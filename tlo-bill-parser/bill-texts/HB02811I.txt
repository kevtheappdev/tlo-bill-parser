|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the prescribing of controlled substances and dangerous  
| drugs for acute pain.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subtitle A, Title 3, Occupations Code, is  
| amended by adding Chapter 107A to read as follows:  
| _CHAPTER 107A. ACUTE PAIN TREATMENT_  
|  _Sec. 107A.001. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Abuse" or "substance abuse" means the maladaptive_  
| _pattern of substance use manifested by recurrent and significant_  
| _adverse consequences related to the repeated use of controlled_  
| _substances or other drugs._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Acute pain" means the normal, predicted,_  
| _physiological response to a stimulus such as trauma, disease, and_  
| _operative procedures. Acute pain is time limited. The term does not_  
| _include:_  
|  _(A) chronic pain;_  
|  _(B) pain being treated as part of cancer care;_  
|  _(C)_ _____pain being treated as part of hospice or_  
| _other end-of-life care; or_  
|  _(D)_ _____pain being treated as part of palliative_  
| _care._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Addiction" means a primary, chronic, or_  
| _neurobiological disease characterized by craving and compulsive_  
| _use of drugs. Addiction is often characterized by impaired control_  
| _over drug use, including taking more drugs more often than_  
| _prescribed by a physician. It may also be characterized by_  
| _continued use despite harm to oneself or others. Genetic,_  
| _psychosocial, and environmental factors may influence the_  
| _development and manifestation of addiction. Physical dependence_  
| _and tolerance are normal physiological consequences of extended_  
| _drug therapy for pain and, alone, do not indicate addiction._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Chronic pain" means a state in which pain_  
| _persists beyond the usual course of an acute disease or healing of_  
| _an injury. Chronic pain may be associated with a chronic_  
| _pathological process that causes continuous or intermittent pain_  
| _over months or years._  
|  _(5)_ _____"Controlled substance" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 481.002, Health and Safety Code._  
|  _(6)_ _____"Dangerous drug" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 483.001, Health and Safety Code._  
|  _(7)_ _____"Diversion" means the use of drugs by anyone other_  
| _than the person for whom the drug was prescribed._  
|  _(8)_ _____"Pain" means an unpleasant sensory and emotional_  
| _experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage._  
|  _(9)_ _____"Physical dependence" means a state of adaptation_  
| _that is manifested by drug class-specific signs and symptoms that_  
| _can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction,_  
| _decreasing blood level of the drug, or administration of an_  
| _antagonist._  
|  _(10)_ _____"Practitioner" means a person, other than a_  
| _veterinarian, authorized to prescribe a controlled substance._  
|  _(11)_ _____"Tolerance" means a physiological state_  
| _resulting from regular use of a drug in which an increased dosage is_  
| _needed to produce a specific effect or in which a reduced effect is_  
| _observed with a constant dose over time. Tolerance does not_  
| _necessarily occur during opioid treatment and does not, alone,_  
| _indicate addiction._  
|  _(12)_ _____"Withdrawal" means the physiological and mental_  
| _readjustment that accompanies discontinuation of a drug for which a_  
| _person has established a physical dependency._  
|  _Sec._ ___107A.002._ _____EVALUATION OF PATIENT WITH ACUTE PAIN. (a)_

| _considering whether the treatment meets the generally accepted_  
| _standard of care._

| _substance abuse or diversion; and_  
|  _(6)_ _____the presence of one or more recognized medical_  
| _indications for the use of a controlled substance or dangerous_  
| _drug._  
|  _(d)_ _____Before prescribing a controlled substance or dangerous_  
| _drug for the treatment of acute pain, a practitioner must review_  
| _prescription data and history related to the patient under Section_  
| _481.076, Health and Safety Code._  
|  _(e)_ _____If a practitioner determines that the steps under_  
| _Subsection (d) are not necessary before prescribing a controlled_

| _surrogate or guardian if the patient may not give consent for the_

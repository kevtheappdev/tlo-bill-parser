|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the authority of an appraisal review board to direct  
| changes in the appraisal roll and related appraisal records if a  
| residence homestead is sold for less than the appraised value.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 25.25, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (c-1) and amending Subsections (e), (l), and (m) to read  
| as follows:  
|  _(c-1)_ _____The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief_  
| _appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order_  
| _changes in the appraisal roll or related records as provided by this_  
| _subsection. The board may order the appraised value of the owner's_  
| _property in the current tax year and either of the two preceding tax_  
| _years to be changed to the sales price of the property in the_  
| _current tax year if, for each tax year for which the change is to be_  
| _made:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the property qualifies as that owner's residence_  
| _homestead;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the sales price of the property is at least 10_  
| _percent less than the appraised value of the property; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the board makes a finding that the sales price_  
| _reflects the market value of the property._  
|  (e) If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not  
| agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the  
| motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c) _,_  
| _(c-1),_ or (d) is entitled on request to a hearing on and a  
| determination of the motion by the appraisal review board. A party  
| bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or  
| errors _or other matter_ that the motion is seeking to correct. Not  
| later than 15 days before the date of the hearing, the board shall  
| deliver written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing  
| to the chief appraiser, the property owner, and the presiding  
| officer of the governing body of each taxing unit in which the  
| property is located. The chief appraiser, the property owner, and  
| each taxing unit are entitled to present evidence and argument at  
| the hearing and to receive written notice of the board's  
| determination of the motion. The property owner is entitled to  
| elect to present the owner's evidence and argument before, after,  
| or between the cases presented by the chief appraiser and each  
| taxing unit. A property owner who files the motion must comply with  
| the payment requirements of Section 25.26 or forfeit the right to a  
| final determination of the motion.  
|  (l) A motion may be filed under Subsection (c) _or (c-1)_  
| regardless of whether, for a tax year to which the motion relates,  
| the owner of the property protested under Chapter 41 an action  
| relating to the value of the property that is the subject of the  
| motion.  
|  (m) The hearing on a motion under Subsection (c) _, (c-1),_ or  
| (d) shall be conducted in the manner provided by Subchapter C,  
| Chapter 41.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a motion to correct an appraisal roll filed on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A motion to correct an appraisal roll  
| filed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the motion was filed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

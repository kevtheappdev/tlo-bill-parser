|  SECTION 3. (a) The Teacher Retirement System of Texas

| supplemental payment is payable not later than September 2021 and,  
| to the extent practicable, on a date or dates that coincide with the  
| regular annuity payment payable to each eligible annuitant.  
|  (c) The amount of the supplemental payment is equal to the  
| lesser of:  
|  (1) the gross amount of the regular annuity payment to  
| which the eligible annuitant is otherwise entitled for the calendar  
| month immediately prior to the calendar month in which the Teacher  
| Retirement System of Texas issues the one-time supplemental payment  
| in accordance with Subsection (b) of this section; or  
|  (2) $2,400.

| withholding and other legally required deductions before  
| disbursing the supplemental payment. A supplemental payment under  
| this section is in addition to and not in lieu of the regular  
| monthly annuity payment to which the eligible annuitant is  
| otherwise entitled.  
|  (e) Subject to Subsection (f) of this section, to be  
| eligible for the supplemental payment, a person must be, for the  
| calendar month immediately prior to the calendar month in which the  
| Teacher Retirement System of Texas issues the one-time supplemental

| Government Code, an annuitant eligible to receive:

| under Section 824.402(a)(3), Government Code; or  
|  (5) an alternate payee annuity payment under Section  
| 804.005, Government Code.  
|  (f) If the annuitant is a retiree or a beneficiary under an  
| optional retirement payment plan, to be eligible for the  
| supplemental payment, the effective date of the retirement of the  
| member of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas must have been on  
| or before December 31, 2018. If the annuitant is a beneficiary  
| under Section 824.402(a)(3) or (4), Government Code, to be eligible  
| for the supplemental payment, the date of death of the member of the  
| retirement system must have been on or before December 31, 2018.  
| The supplemental payment shall be made to an alternate payee who is  
| an annuitant under Section 804.005, Government Code, only if the  
| annuity payment to the alternate payee commenced on or before  
| December 31, 2018. The supplemental payment is in addition to the  
| guaranteed number of payments under Section 824.402(a)(3),  
| Government Code, Section 824.204(c)(3) or (4), Government Code, or  
| Section 824.308(c), Government Code, and may not be counted as one  
| of the guaranteed monthly payments.

| under:  
|  (1) Section 824.304(a), Government Code, relating to  
| disability retirees with less than 10 years of service credit;  
|  (2) Section 824.804(b), Government Code, relating to  
| participants in the deferred retirement option plan with regard to  
| payments from their deferred retirement option plan accounts;  
|  (3) Section 824.501(a), Government Code, relating to  
| retiree survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity in an  
| amount fixed by statute; or  
|  (4) Section 824.404(a), Government Code, relating to  
| active member survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity  
| in an amount fixed by statute.  
|  (h) The board of trustees of the Teacher Retirement System  
| of Texas shall determine the eligibility for and the amount and  
| timing of a supplemental payment and the manner in which the payment  
| is made.  
|  (i) The state shall appropriate to the Teacher Retirement  
| System of Texas an amount equal to the cost of the one-time  
| supplemental payment required by this section. This amount is in  
| addition to the amount the state is required to contribute to the  
| Teacher Retirement System of Texas under Section 825.404,  
| Government Code. If the state does not transfer the appropriated  
| amount described by this subsection, the Teacher Retirement System  
| of Texas shall not issue the one-time supplemental payment required  
| by this section.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

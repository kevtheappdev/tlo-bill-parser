|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the award of good conduct time to certain inmates;  
| changing parole eligibility.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 498.003, Government Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (b), (d), and (e) and adding Subsection  
| (f) to read as follows:  
|  (a) Good conduct time applies only to eligibility for parole  
| or mandatory supervision as provided by Section 508.145 or 508.147  
| and does not otherwise affect an inmate's term. Good conduct time  
| is a privilege and not a right. _The_ [ ~~Regardless of the~~  
|  ~~classification of an inmate, the~~ ] department may grant good conduct  
| time to _an_ [ ~~the~~ ] inmate only _for:_  
|  _(1)_ _____demonstrating good behavior by complying with all_  
| _applicable department rules; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____diligently participating in a program described by_  
| _Subsection (d) or (f)_ [ ~~if the department finds that the inmate is~~  
|  ~~actively engaged in an agricultural, vocational, or educational~~  
|  ~~endeavor, in an industrial program or other work program, or in a~~  
|  ~~treatment program, unless the department finds that the inmate is~~  
|  ~~not capable of participating in such a program or endeavor~~ ].  
|  (b) An inmate accrues good conduct time _described by_  
| _Subsection (a)(1)_ according to the inmate's classification in  
| amounts as follows:  
|  (1) 20 days for each 30 days actually served while the  
| inmate is classified as a trusty, except that the department may  
| award the inmate not more than 10 extra days for each 30 days  
| actually served;  
|  (2) 20 days for each 30 days actually served while the  
| inmate is classified as a Class I inmate; and  
|  (3) 10 days for each 30 days actually served while the  
| inmate is classified as a Class II inmate.  
|  (d) An inmate may accrue good conduct time, in an amount  
| determined by the department that does not exceed 15 days for each  
| 30 days actually served, for diligent participation in an  
| industrial program or other work program or for participation in an  
| agricultural, educational, [ ~~or~~ ] vocational _, or treatment_ program  
| provided to inmates by the department. For the purposes of this  
| subsection, the term "participation in an educational program"  
| includes the participation of the inmate as a tutor or a pupil in a  
| literacy program authorized by Section 501.005. The department may  
| not award good conduct time under this subsection for participation  
| in a literacy program unless the department determines that the  
| inmate participated in good faith and with diligence as a tutor or  
| pupil.  
|  (e) If _an inmate was_ [ ~~a person is~~ ] confined in a county jail,  
| the department shall award good conduct time to the _inmate_ [ ~~person~~ ]  
| up to an amount equal to the amount earned by an inmate in the entry  
| level time earning class.  
|  _(f)_ The department shall award good conduct time to _an_  
| _inmate_ [ ~~a defendant~~ ] for _diligently participating, while confined_  
| _in a county jail,_ [ ~~diligent participation~~ ] in a voluntary work  
| program operated by a sheriff under Article 43.101, Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, in the same manner as if the inmate had  
| diligently participated in an industrial program or other work  
| program provided to inmates by the department. The sheriff of each  
| county shall have attached a certification of the number of days  
| each inmate diligently participated in the volunteer work program  
| operated by the sheriff under Article 43.101, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 508.046, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 508.046. EXTRAORDINARY VOTE REQUIRED. To release on  
| parole an inmate who was convicted of an offense under Section  
| 20A.03, 21.02, 21.11(a)(1), or 22.021, Penal Code, or who is  
| _serving a sentence under Section 12.42(c)(2), Penal Code_ [ ~~required~~  
|  ~~under Section 508.145(c) to serve 35 calendar years before becoming~~  
|  ~~eligible for release on parole~~ ], all members of the board must vote  
| on the release on parole of the inmate, and at least two-thirds of  
| the members must vote in favor of the release on parole. A member of  
| the board may not vote on the release unless the member first  
| receives a copy of a written report from the department on the  
| probability that the inmate would commit an offense after being  
| released on parole.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 508.145(b) and (c), Government Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) An inmate serving a life sentence under Section  
| 12.31(a)(1), Penal Code, for a capital felony is not eligible for  
| release on parole until the actual calendar time the inmate has  
| served _plus good conduct time described by Section 498.003(a)(2)_ ,  
| without consideration of _any other_ good conduct time, equals 40  
| calendar years.  
|  (c) An inmate serving a sentence under Section 12.42(c)(2),  
| Penal Code, is not eligible for release on parole until the actual  
| calendar time the inmate has served _plus good conduct time_  
| _described by Section 498.003(a)(2)_ , without consideration of _any_  
| _other_ good conduct time, equals 35 calendar years.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 508.145(d)(2), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (2) An inmate described by Subdivision (1) is not  
| eligible for release on parole until the inmate's actual calendar  
| time served _plus good conduct time described by Section_  
| _498.003(a)(2)_ , without consideration of _any other_ good conduct  
| time, equals one-half of the sentence or 30 calendar years,  
| whichever is less, but in no event is the inmate eligible for  
| release on parole in less than two calendar years.  
|  SECTION 5. The change in law made by this Act applies to any  
| inmate who is confined in a facility operated by or under contract  
| with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on or after the  
| effective date of this Act, regardless of whether the offense for  
| which the inmate is confined occurred before, on, or after the  
| effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

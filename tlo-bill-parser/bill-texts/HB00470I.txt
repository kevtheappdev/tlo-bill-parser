|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the calculation of the ad valorem rollback tax rate of a  
| taxing unit and voter approval of a proposed tax rate that exceeds  
| the rollback tax rate.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 26.012, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subdivision (18) to read as follows:  
|  _(18)_ _____"Small taxing unit" means a taxing unit, other_  
| _than a school district, with a population of less than 40,000._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 26.04, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsection (c) and adding Subsection (c-1) to read as follows:  
|  (c) An officer or employee designated by the governing body  
| shall calculate the effective tax rate and the rollback tax rate for  
| the _taxing_ unit, where:  
|  (1) "Effective tax rate" means a rate expressed in  
| dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the  
| following formula:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = (LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)  
|  ; and  
|  (2) "Rollback tax rate" means a rate expressed in  
| dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the  
| following _applicable_ formula:  
|  _(A) for a small taxing unit:_  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND  
| OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT RATE  
|  _; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____for a taxing unit other than a small taxing_  
| _unit:_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND_  
| _OPERATIONS RATE x 1.04) + CURRENT DEBT RATE_  
|  _(c-1)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,_  
| _the governing body of a taxing unit other than a small taxing unit_  
| _may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the_  
| _rollback tax rate of the taxing unit according to the formula_  
| _applicable to a small taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is_  
| _located in an area declared a disaster area during the current tax_  
| _year by the governor or by the president of the United States._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 26.041, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a), (b), and (c) and adding Subsection (c-1) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) In the first year in which an additional sales and use  
| tax is required to be collected, the effective tax rate and rollback  
| tax rate for the _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the  
| following formulas:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = _[_ (LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE) _]_ \-  
| SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = (EFFECTIVE  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT  
| RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE  
| _and_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS_  
| _RATE x 1.04) + CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE_  
| where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following  
| year as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the  
| current total value.  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ], in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional  
| sales and use tax _,_ the rollback tax rate for the _taxing_ unit is  
| calculated according to the following _applicable_ formula,  
| regardless of whether the _taxing_ unit levied a property tax in the  
| preceding year:  
|  ROLLBACK _TAX_ RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ]  
| CURRENT _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT  
| DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)  
| _or_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS_  
| _EXPENSE x 1.04) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY_  
| _VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)_  
| where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the  
| amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and  
| additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and  
| "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will  
| be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year  
| as calculated under Subsection (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ] by the current  
| total value.  
|  (c) In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing  
| an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales  
| and use tax _,_ the effective tax rate and rollback tax rate for the  
| _taxing_ unit are calculated according to the following formulas:  
|  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY  
| LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] +  
| SALES TAX LOSS RATE  
| [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  ROLLBACK TAX RATE _FOR SMALL TAXING UNIT_ = [(LAST YEAR'S  
| MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / ([ ~~TOTAL~~ ]  
| CURRENT _TOTAL_ VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT  
| DEBT RATE  
| _and_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SMALL_  
| _TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS_  
| _EXPENSE x 1.04) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY_  
| _VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE_  
| where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per  
| $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales  
| and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which  
| the information is available by the current total value and "last  
| year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent  
| for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional  
| sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.  
|  _(c-1)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,_  
| _the governing body of a taxing unit other than a small taxing unit_  
| _may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the_  
| _rollback tax rate of the taxing unit according to the formula_  
| _applicable to a small taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is_  
| _located in an area declared a disaster area during the current tax_  
| _year by the governor or by the president of the United States._  
|  SECTION 4. The heading to Section 26.043, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.043. _ROLLBACK AND_ EFFECTIVE TAX _RATES_ [ ~~RATE~~ ] IN  
| CITY IMPOSING MASS TRANSIT SALES AND USE TAX.

| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.07. ELECTION TO _REDUCE TAX RATE OF SMALL TAXING UNIT_  
| [ ~~REPEAL INCREASE~~ ].  
|  SECTION 6. Section 26.07(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) If the governing body of a _small_ taxing unit [ ~~other than~~  
|  ~~a school district~~ ] adopts a tax rate that exceeds the _taxing unit's_  
| rollback tax rate calculated as provided by this chapter, the  
| qualified voters of the taxing unit by petition may require that an  
| election be held to determine whether or not to reduce the tax rate  
| adopted for the current year to the rollback tax rate calculated as  
| provided by this chapter.  
|  SECTION 7. The heading to Section 26.08, Tax Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 26.08. ELECTION TO _APPROVE TAX RATE OF TAXING UNIT_  
| _OTHER THAN SMALL TAXING UNIT_ [ ~~RATIFY SCHOOL TAXES~~ ].  
|  SECTION 8. Section 26.08, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a), (b), (d), (d-1), (d-2), (e), and (h) and adding  
| Subsection (r) to read as follows:  
|  (a) If the governing body of a _taxing unit other than a small_  
| _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] adopts a tax rate that exceeds the  
| _taxing unit's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] rollback tax rate, the registered voters  
| of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ] at an election held for that purpose  
| must determine whether to approve the adopted tax rate. When  
| increased expenditure of money by a _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]  
| is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado,  
| hurricane, flood, or other calamity, but not including a drought,  
| that has impacted _the taxing unit_ [ ~~a school district~~ ] and the  
| governor has requested federal disaster assistance for the area in  
| which the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] is located, an election is  
| not required under this section to approve the tax rate adopted by  
| the governing body for the year following the year in which the  
| disaster occurs.  
|  (b) The governing body shall order that the election be held  
| in the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] on a date not less than 30 or  
| more than 90 days after the day on which it adopted the tax rate.  
| Section 41.001, Election Code, does not apply to the election  
| unless a date specified by that section falls within the time  
| permitted by this section. At the election, the ballots shall be  
| prepared to permit voting for or against the proposition:  
| "Approving the ad valorem tax rate of $_____ per $100 valuation in  
| (name of _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]) for the current year, a rate  
| that is $_____ higher per $100 valuation than the [ ~~school district~~ ]  
| rollback tax rate _of (name of taxing unit)_ , for the purpose of  
| (description of purpose of increase)." The ballot proposition must  
| include the adopted tax rate and the difference between that rate  
| and the rollback tax rate in the appropriate places.  
|  (d) If the proposition is not approved as provided by  
| Subsection (c), the governing body may not adopt a tax rate for the  
| _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] for the current year that exceeds the  
| _taxing unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] rollback tax rate.  
|  (d-1) If, after tax bills for the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school~~  
|  ~~district~~ ] have been mailed, a proposition to approve the _taxing_  
| _unit's_ [ ~~school district's~~ ] adopted tax rate is not approved by the  
| voters of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ] at an election held under this  
| section, on subsequent adoption of a new tax rate by the governing  
| body of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ], the assessor for the _taxing
unit_  
| [ ~~school~~ ] shall prepare and mail corrected tax bills. The assessor  
| shall include with each bill a brief explanation of the reason for  
| and effect of the corrected bill. The date on which the taxes  
| become delinquent for the year is extended by a number of days equal  
| to the number of days between the date the first tax bills were sent  
| and the date the corrected tax bills were sent.  
|  (d-2) If a property owner pays taxes calculated using the  
| originally adopted tax rate of the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ]  
| and the proposition to approve the adopted tax rate is not approved  
| by _the_ voters, the _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the  
| difference between the amount of taxes paid and the amount due under  
| the subsequently adopted rate if the difference between the amount  
| of taxes paid and the amount due under the subsequent rate is $1 or  
| more. If the difference between the amount of taxes paid and the  
| amount due under the subsequent rate is less than $1, the _taxing_  
| _unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ] shall refund the difference on request of  
| the taxpayer. An application for a refund of less than $1 must be  
| made within 90 days after the date the refund becomes due or the  
| taxpayer forfeits the right to the refund.  
|  (e) For purposes of this section, local tax funds dedicated  
| to a junior college district under Section 45.105(e), Education  
| Code, shall be eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate  
| adopted by the governing body of _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] school district. However,  
| the funds dedicated to the junior college district are subject to  
| Section 26.085.  
|  (h) For purposes of this section, increases in taxable  
| values and tax levies occurring within a reinvestment zone  
| _designated_ under Chapter 311 [ ~~(Tax Increment Financing Act),~~ ] in  
| which _a school_ [ ~~the~~ ] district is a participant[ ~~,~~ ] shall be  
| eliminated from the calculation of the tax rate adopted by the  
| governing body of the school district.  
|  _(r)_ _____Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, this_  
| _section does not apply to a tax imposed by a taxing unit if a_  
| _provision of an uncodified local or special law enacted by the 86th_  
| _Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, or by an earlier legislature_  
| _provides that Section 26.07 does not apply to a tax imposed by the_  
| _taxing unit._  
|  SECTION 9. Section 26.16(d), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d) The county assessor-collector shall post immediately  
| below the table prescribed by Subsection (c) the following  
| statement:  
|  "The county is providing this table of property tax rate  
| information as a service to the residents of the county. Each  
| individual taxing unit is responsible for calculating the property  
| tax rates listed in this table pertaining to that taxing unit and  
| providing that information to the county.  
|  "The adopted tax rate is the tax rate adopted by the governing  
| body of a taxing unit.  
|  "The maintenance and operations rate is the component of the  
| adopted tax rate of a taxing unit that will impose the amount of  
| taxes needed to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the  
| _taxing_ unit for the following year.  
|  "The debt rate is the component of the adopted tax rate of a  
| taxing unit that will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund the  
| _taxing_ unit's debt service for the following year.  
|  "The effective tax rate is the tax rate that would generate  
| the same amount of revenue in the current tax year as was generated  
| by a taxing unit's adopted tax rate in the preceding tax year from  
| property that is taxable in both the current tax year and the  
| preceding tax year.  
|  "The effective maintenance and operations rate is the tax  
| rate that would generate the same amount of revenue for maintenance  
| and operations in the current tax year as was generated by a taxing  
| unit's maintenance and operations rate in the preceding tax year  
| from property that is taxable in both the current tax year and the  
| preceding tax year.  
|  "The rollback tax rate is the highest tax rate a taxing unit  
| may adopt before requiring voter approval at an election. In the  
| case of a _small_ taxing unit [ ~~other than a school district~~ ], the  
| voters by petition may require that a rollback election be held if  
| the _taxing_ unit adopts a tax rate in excess of the _taxing_ unit's  
| rollback tax rate. In the case of a _taxing unit other than a small_  
| _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district~~ ], an election will automatically be  
| held if the _taxing unit_ [ ~~district~~ ] wishes to adopt a tax rate in  
| excess of the _taxing unit's_ [ ~~district's~~ ] rollback tax rate."  
|  SECTION 10. Sections 31.12(a) and (b), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) If a refund of a tax provided by Section 11.431(b),  
| 26.07(g), _26.08(d-2),_ 26.15(f), 31.11, 31.111, or 31.112 is paid on  
| or before the 60th day after the date the liability for the refund  
| arises, no interest is due on the amount refunded. If not paid on or  
| before that 60th day, the amount of the tax to be refunded accrues  
| interest at a rate of one percent for each month or part of a month  
| that the refund is unpaid, beginning with the date on which the  
| liability for the refund arises.  
|  (b) For purposes of this section, liability for a refund  
| arises:  
|  (1) if the refund is required by Section 11.431(b), on  
| the date the chief appraiser notifies the collector for the _taxing_  
| unit of the approval of the late homestead exemption;  
|  (2) if the refund is required by Section 26.07(g), on  
| the date the results of the election to reduce the tax rate are  
| certified;  
|  (3) _if the refund is required by Section 26.08(d-2),_  
| _on the date the subsequent tax rate is adopted;_  
|  _(4)_ if the refund is required by Section 26.15(f):  
|  (A) for a correction to the tax roll made under  
| Section 26.15(b), on the date the change in the tax roll is  
| certified to the assessor for the taxing unit under Section 25.25;  
| or  
|  (B) for a correction to the tax roll made under  
| Section 26.15(c), on the date the change in the tax roll is ordered  
| by the governing body of the taxing unit;  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] if the refund is required by Section 31.11,  
| on the date the auditor for the taxing unit determines that the  
| payment was erroneous or excessive or, if the amount of the refund  
| exceeds the applicable amount specified by Section 31.11(a), on the  
| date the governing body of the _taxing_ unit approves the refund;  
|  _(6)_ [ ~~(5)~~ ] if the refund is required by Section 31.111,  
| on the date the collector for the taxing unit determines that the  
| payment was erroneous; or  
|  _(7)_ [ ~~(6)~~ ] if the refund is required by Section 31.112,  
| on the date required by Section 31.112(d) or (e), as applicable.  
|  SECTION 11. Section 33.08(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) The governing body of the taxing unit or appraisal  
| district, in the manner required by law for official action, may  
| provide that taxes that become delinquent on or after June 1 under  
| Section 26.07(f), _26.08(d-1),_ 26.15(e), 31.03, 31.031, 31.032,  
| 31.04, or 42.42 incur an additional penalty to defray costs of  
| collection. The amount of the penalty may not exceed the amount of  
| the compensation specified in the applicable contract with an  
| attorney under Section 6.30 to be paid in connection with the  
| collection of the delinquent taxes.  
|  SECTION 12. Section 130.016(b), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) If the board of trustees of an independent school  
| district that divests itself of the management, control, and  
| operation of a junior college district under this section or under  
| Section 130.017 [ ~~of this code~~ ] was authorized by [ ~~Subsection (e)~~  
|  ~~of~~ ] Section _45.105(e) or under former Section 20.48(e)_ [ ~~20.48
of~~  
|  ~~this code~~ ] to dedicate a portion of its tax levy to the junior  
| college district before the divestment, the junior college district  
| may levy an ad valorem tax from and after the divestment. In the  
| first two years in which the junior college district levies an ad  
| valorem tax, the tax rate adopted by the governing body may not  
| exceed the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value  
| submitted to the governing body under Section 26.04, Tax Code,  
| would impose an amount equal to the amount of taxes of the school  
| district dedicated to the junior college under [ ~~Subsection (e) of~~ ]  
| Section _45.105(e) or former Section 20.48(e)_ [ ~~20.48 of this code~~ ]  
| in the last dedication before the divestment. In subsequent years,  
| the tax rate of the junior college district is subject to Section  
| 26.07 _or 26.08_ , Tax Code _, as applicable_.  
|  SECTION 13. Sections 281.124(d) and (e), Health and Safety  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) If a majority of the votes cast in the election favor the  
| proposition, the tax rate for the specified tax year is the rate  
| approved by the voters, and that rate is not subject to a rollback  
| election under Section 26.07 _or 26.08_ , Tax Code. The board shall  
| adopt the tax rate as provided by Chapter 26, Tax Code _, as_  
| _applicable_.  
|  (e) If the proposition is not approved as provided by  
| Subsection _(d)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ], the board may not adopt a tax rate for the  
| district for the specified tax year that exceeds the rate that was  
| not approved, and Section 26.07 _or 26.08_ , Tax Code, _as applicable,_  
| applies to the adopted rate if that rate exceeds the _district's_  
| rollback tax rate.  
|  SECTION 14. Section 140.010, Local Government Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (a), (e), (f), and (g) and adding  
| Subsection (e-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) In this section _:_  
|  _(1) "Effective_[ ~~, "effective~~ ] tax rate" and "rollback  
| tax rate" mean the effective tax rate and rollback tax rate of a  
| county or municipality, as applicable, as calculated under Chapter  
| 26, Tax Code.  
|  _(2)_ _____"Small taxing unit" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 26.012, Tax Code._  
|  (e) A county or municipality that _is a small taxing unit and_  
| _that_ proposes a property tax rate that exceeds the lower of the  
| effective tax rate or the rollback tax rate shall provide the  
| following notice:

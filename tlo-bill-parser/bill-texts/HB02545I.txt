| _(c)(1)(A), (c)(2)(A), or (c)(3), any amount received by the entity_  
| _from the sale of minerals or materials extracted from water by the_  
| _desalination facility during the desalination process._ ___In this_  
| _subsection, "desalination facility"_ ___and "permit holder"_ ___have the_

| _SUBCHAPTER L-1. TAX CREDIT FOR OPERATION OF DESALINATION FACILITY_  
|  _Sec. 171.621. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Commission" means the Texas Commission on_  
| _Environmental Quality._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Desalination facility" means a facility that_  
| _treats source water that has a high total dissolved solids_  
| _concentration, such as water produced in oil or gas drilling,_  
| _completion, flowback, or production, to produce fresh water of_  
| _usable quality for public, agricultural, industrial,_  
| _environmental, and other beneficial uses._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Permit holder" means a person who operates a_  
| _desalination facility and has all state and federal permits_  
| _necessary to operate the facility._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.622._ _____ELIGIBILITY FOR CREDIT. A permit holder that_  
| _produces fresh water of usable quality at a desalination facility_  
| _is eligible for a credit in the amount and under the conditions and_  
| _limitations provided by this subchapter against the tax imposed_  
| _under this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.623._ _____AMOUNT OF CREDIT; LIMITATIONS. (a) Except as_  
| _provided by Subsection (d), the total amount of the credit under_  
| _this subchapter for the period on which a report is based is equal_  
| _to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____$1 for each 1,000 gallons of source water treated_  
| _by the permit holder during the period on which the report is based_  
| _if:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the source water has a total dissolved solids_  
| _concentration of more than 3,000 milligrams per liter; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the resulting fresh water is put to_  
| _beneficial use in this state;_  
|  _(2)_ _____$5 for each 1,000 gallons of source water treated_  
| _by the permit holder during the period on which the report is based_  
| _if:_  
|  _(A)_ _____at least 50 percent of the source water has a_  
| _total dissolved solids concentration of more than 70,000 milligrams_  
| _per liter; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the resulting fresh water is put to_  
| _beneficial use in this state; and_

| _per liter; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the resulting fresh water is put to_  
| _beneficial use in this state._  
|  _(b)_ _____The permit holder may treat source water with differing_  
| _total dissolved solids concentrations during the period on which_

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to permits for certain injection wells that transect a  
| portion of the Edwards Aquifer.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 27.0516(a)(1) and (3), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (1) "Edwards Aquifer" means that portion of an arcuate  
| belt of porous, waterbearing limestones composed of the Edwards  
| Formation, Georgetown Formation, Comanche Peak Formation, Salmon  
| Peak Limestone, McKnight Formation, West Nueces Formation, Devil's  
| River Limestone, Person Formation, Kainer Formation, and Edwards  
| Group _, together with the Upper Glen Rose Formation where there is a_  
| _significant hydrological connection to the overlying Edwards Group_  
| [ ~~trending from west to east to northeast through Kinney, Uvalde,~~  
|  ~~Medina, Bexar, Kendall, Comal, Hays, Travis, and Williamson~~  
|  ~~Counties~~ ].  The permeable aquifer units generally overlie the  
| less-permeable Glen Rose Formation to the south[ ~~, overlie the~~  
|  ~~less-permeable Comanche Peak and Walnut Formations north of the~~  
|  ~~Colorado River,~~ ] and underlie the less-permeable Del Rio Clay  
| regionally.  
|  (3) "Fresh water" means surface water or groundwater,  
| without regard to whether the water has been physically,  
| chemically, or biologically altered, that:  
|  (A) contains a total dissolved solids  
| concentration of not more than 1,000 milligrams per liter; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (B) _meets the water quality standards for public_  
| _drinking water established by commission rule; and_  
|  _(C)_ is otherwise suitable as a source of drinking  
| water supply.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 27.0516(b), (f), (h), (k), and (n),  
| Water Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) This section applies only to the portion of the Edwards  
| Aquifer that is within the geographic area circumscribed by the  
| external boundaries of the Barton Springs-Edwards Aquifer  
| Conservation District but is not in _the jurisdiction_ [ ~~that~~  
|  ~~district's territory or the territory~~ ] of the Edwards Aquifer  
| Authority.  
|  (f) The commission by general permit may authorize:  
|  (1) an activity described by Subsection (e);  
|  (2) an injection well that transects and isolates the  
| saline portion of the Edwards Aquifer and terminates in a lower  
| aquifer for the purpose of injecting:  
|  (A) concentrate from a desalination facility; or  
|  (B) fresh water as part of an engineered aquifer  
| storage and recovery facility;  
|  (3) an injection well that terminates in that part of  
| the saline portion of the Edwards Aquifer that has a total dissolved  
| solids concentration of more than 10,000 milligrams per liter for  
| the purpose of injecting into the saline portion of the Edwards  
| Aquifer:  
|  (A) concentrate from a desalination facility,  
| provided that the injection well must be at least three miles from  
| the closest outlet of Barton Springs; or  
|  (B) fresh water as part of an engineered aquifer  
| and storage recovery facility, provided that each well used for  
| injection or withdrawal from the facility must be at least three  
| miles from the closest outlet of Barton Springs; [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (4) an injection well that transects or terminates in  
| the Edwards Aquifer for:  
|  (A) aquifer remediation;  
|  (B) the injection of a nontoxic tracer dye as  
| part of a hydrologic study; or  
|  (C) another beneficial activity that is designed  
| and undertaken for the purpose of increasing protection of an  
| underground source of drinking water from pollution or other  
| deleterious effects _; or_  
|  _(5)_ _____the injection of fresh water into a well that_  
| _transects the Edwards Aquifer provided that:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the well isolates the Edwards Aquifer and_  
| _meets the construction and completion standards adopted by the_  
| _commission under Section 27.154;_  
|  _(B)_ _____the well is part of an engineered aquifer_  
| _storage and recovery facility;_  
|  _(C)_ _____the injected water is sourced from a public_  
| _water system, as defined by commission rule, that is permitted by_  
| _the commission; and_  
|  _(D)_ _____the injection complies with the provisions of_  
| _Subchapter G that are not in conflict with this section_.  
|  (h) Rules adopted or a general permit issued under this  
| section:  
|  (1) must require that an injection well authorized by  
| the rules or permit be monitored by means of:  
|  (A) _one or more_ [ ~~a~~ ] monitoring _wells_ [ ~~well~~ ]  
| operated by the injection well owner if the commission determines  
| that there is an underground source of drinking water in the area of  
| review that is potentially affected by the injection well; or  
|  (B) if Paragraph (A) does not apply, _one or more_  
| [ ~~a~~ ] monitoring _wells_ [ ~~well~~ ] operated by a party other than the  
| injection well owner, provided that all results of monitoring are  
| promptly made available to the injection well owner;  
|  (2) must ensure that an authorized activity will not  
| result in the waste or pollution of _native groundwater_ [ ~~fresh~~  
|  ~~water~~ ];  
|  (3) may not authorize an injection well under  
| Subsection (f)(2) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (3) _, or (5)_ unless the well is initially  
| associated with a small-scale research project designed to evaluate  
| the long-term feasibility and safety of:  
|  (A) the injection of concentrate from a  
| desalination facility; or  
|  (B) an aquifer storage and recovery project;  
|  (4) must require any authorization granted to be  
| renewed at least as frequently as every 10 years;  
|  (5) must require that an injection well authorized  
| under Subsection (f)(2)(A) or (3)(A) be monitored on an ongoing  
| basis by or in coordination with the well owner and that the well  
| owner file monitoring reports with the commission at least as  
| frequently as every three months; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (6) must ensure that any injection well authorized for  
| the purpose of injecting concentrate from a desalination facility  
| does not transect the fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer _;_  
| _and_  
|  _(7)_ _____must be consistent with the provisions of_  
| _Subchapter G that are not in conflict with this section_.  
|  (k) Notwithstanding Subsection (h)(3), a general permit may  
| authorize the owner of an injection well authorized under  
| Subsection (f)(2) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (3) _, or (5)_ to continue operating the
well  
| for the purpose of implementing the desalination or engineered  
| aquifer storage and recovery project following completion of the  
| small-scale research project, provided that:  
|  (1) the injection well owner timely submits the  
| information collected as part of the research project, including  
| monitoring reports and information regarding the environmental  
| impact of the well, to the commission;  
|  (2) the injection well owner, following the completion  
| of studies and monitoring adequate to characterize risks to the  
| fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer _, the Trinity Aquifer, or_  
| [ ~~and~~ ] other _native groundwater_ [ ~~fresh water~~ ] associated with
the  
| continued operation of the well, and at least 90 days before the  
| date the owner initiates commercial well operations, files with the  
| commission a notice of intent to continue operation of the well  
| after completion of the research project; and  
|  (3) the commission, based on the studies and  
| monitoring, the report provided by Texas State University--San  
| Marcos under Subsection (l)(2), and any other reasonably available  
| information, determines that continued operation of the injection  
| well as described in the notice of intent does not pose an  
| unreasonable risk to the fresh water portion of the Edwards  
| Aquifer _, the Trinity Aquifer,_ or other _native groundwater_ [ ~~fresh~~  
|  ~~water~~ ] associated with the continued operation of the well.  
|  (n) If the commission preliminarily determines that  
| continued operation of the injection well would pose an  
| unreasonable risk to the fresh water portion of the Edwards  
| Aquifer _, the Trinity Aquifer,_ or other _native groundwater_ [ ~~fresh~~  
|  ~~water~~ ] associated with the continued operation of the well, the  
| commission shall notify the operator and specify, if possible, what  
| well modifications _or operational controls_ would be adequate to  
| prevent that unreasonable risk.  If the operator fails to modify the  
| injection well as specified by the commission, the commission shall  
| require the operator to cease operating the well.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

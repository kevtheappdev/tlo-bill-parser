|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the matters that a taxing unit is entitled to challenge  
| before an appraisal review board.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 41.03(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) A taxing unit is entitled to challenge before the  
| appraisal review board:  
|  (1) [ ~~the level of appraisals of any category of~~  
|  ~~property in the district or in any territory in the district, but~~  
|  ~~not the appraised value of a single taxpayer's property;~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ] an exclusion of property from the appraisal  
| records;  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] a grant in whole or in part of a partial  
| exemption;  
|  _(3)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] a determination that land qualifies for  
| appraisal as provided by Subchapter C, D, E, or H, Chapter 23; or  
|  _(4)_ [ ~~(5)~~ ] failure to identify the taxing unit as one  
| in which a particular property is taxable.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a challenge under Chapter 41, Tax Code, for which a challenge  
| petition is filed on or after the effective date of this Act.  A  
| challenge under Chapter 41, Tax Code, for which a challenge  
| petition was filed before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the challenge petition was filed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

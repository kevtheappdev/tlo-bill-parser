|  AN ACT  
| relating to claims settlement for automobile insurance.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subtitle C, Title 10, Insurance Code, is amended  
| by adding Chapter 1955 to read as follows:  
| _CHAPTER 1955. CLAIMS SETTLEMENT FOR AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE_  
|  _Sec._ ___1955.0001._ _____PURPOSE. The purpose of this chapter is to_  
| _protect those injured by motorists from predatory practices engaged_  
| _in by personal and commercial automobile insurers that seek to_  
| _induce injured motorists into settling and releasing their legal_  
| _claims for an amount that is insufficient to compensate their_  
| _losses at a time when these losses are not known with any certainty,_  
| _resulting in costs both to the injured person and medical providers_  
| _whose care and services may go uncompensated as a result of those_  
| _predatory insurance practices._  
|  _Sec. 1955.0002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Claimant" means an individual who has a claim for_  
| _an injury against another individual or an entity._  
|  _(2) "Injury" means a bodily or psychological injury._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Release" means a written or oral contract under_  
| _which a claimant releases, wholly or partly, one or more of the_  
| _claimant's claims arising out of an injury for which an insurer may_  
| _be liable under an automobile insurance policy in exchange for_  
| _money or other consideration paid by any releasee._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Releasee" means an individual, entity, or insurer_  
| _released from a claimant's claim in a release._  
|  _Sec._ ___1955.0003._ _____APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER. This chapter_  
| _applies to an insurer writing personal or commercial automobile_  
| _insurance in this state, including an insurance company,_  
| _corporation, reciprocal or interinsurance exchange, mutual_  
| _insurance company, association, Lloyd's plan, or other insurer._  
|  _Sec._ ___1955.0004._ _____VOIDABLE RELEASE OF CLAIMS. (a)_ ___A release_  
| _is voidable by the claimant in accordance with this section if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the claimant entered into the release on or before_  
| _the 45th day after the date the cause of action that is the basis for_  
| _the released claim accrued; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the claimant was not represented by an attorney at_  
| _the time the claimant entered into the release._  
|  _(b)_ _____Not later than the first anniversary after the date the_  
| _release was entered into, a claimant may void a release under this_  
| _section by providing written notice of the claimant's intent to_  
| _void the release to each releasee._  
|  _(c)_ _____Any consideration paid to the claimant by or on behalf_  
| _of the releasee in exchange for a release voided under this section_  
| _must be credited against any award or payment made in connection_  
| _with a claim against the releasee arising from the cause of action_  
| _that is the basis for the previously released claim._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an automobile insurance policy delivered, issued for delivery, or  
| renewed on or after January 1, 2020. A policy delivered, issued for  
| delivery, or renewed before January 1, 2020, is governed by the law  
| as it existed immediately before the effective date of this Act, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

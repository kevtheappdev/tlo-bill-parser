| relating to the coverage of damage from tornadoes and wildfires by  
| the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association.

| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 2210.001. PURPOSE. The primary purpose of the Texas  
| Windstorm Insurance Association is the provision of an adequate  
| market for windstorm and hail insurance in the seacoast territory  
| of this state _and tornado insurance and wildfire insurance_  
| _statewide_. The legislature finds that the provision of adequate  
| windstorm and hail insurance _, tornado insurance, and wildfire_  
| _insurance_ is necessary to the economic welfare of this state, and  
| without that insurance, the orderly growth and development of this  
| state would be severely impeded. This chapter provides a method by  
| which adequate windstorm and hail insurance may be obtained in  
| certain designated portions of the seacoast territory of this state  
| _and tornado insurance and wildfire insurance may be obtained_  
| _statewide_. The association is intended to serve as a residual  
| insurer of last resort for windstorm and hail insurance in the  
| seacoast territory _and tornado insurance and wildfire insurance_  
| _statewide_. The association shall:  
|  (1) function in such a manner as to not be a direct  
| competitor in the private market; and  
|  (2) provide windstorm and hail insurance coverage _,_  
| _tornado insurance coverage, and wildfire insurance coverage_ to  
| those who are unable to obtain [ ~~that~~ ] coverage in the private  
| market.

|  _(B)_ _____indirect losses resulting from the direct_  
| _loss._  
|  _(15)_ _____"Wildfire" means an uncontrolled blaze fueled by_  
| _weather, wind, and dry underbrush, trees, grasses, and other_  
| _flammable material._  
|  _(16) "Wildfire insurance" means insurance against:_  
|  _(A)_ _____direct loss to insurable property incurred as_  
| _a result of wildfire, as those terms are defined and limited in_  
| _policies and forms approved by the department; and_

| this chapter and subject to this section, "insurable property"

| hail _, tornado, and wildfire_ , as determined by normal underwriting  
| standards. The term includes property described by Section  
| 2210.209.  
|  (b) A structure located in a catastrophe area, construction  
| of which began on or after the 30th day after the date of  
| publication of the plan of operation, that is not built in  
| compliance with building specifications set forth in the plan of  
| operation or continued in compliance with those specifications,  
| does not constitute an insurable risk for purposes of windstorm and  
| hail insurance _, tornado insurance, or wildfire insurance_ except as  
| otherwise provided by this chapter.  
|  (c) A structure, or an addition to a structure, that is  
| constructed in conformity with plans and specifications that comply  
| with the specifications set forth in the plan of operation at the  
| time construction begins may not be declared ineligible for  
| windstorm and hail insurance _, tornado insurance, or wildfire_  
| _insurance_ as a result of subsequent changes in the building  
| specifications set forth in the plan of operation.  
|  (d) Except as otherwise provided by this section, if repair  
| of damage to a structure involves replacement of items covered in

| commissioner determines, unless such a determination results in an  
| adverse impact to the exposure of the association, that windstorm  
| and hail insurance _, tornado insurance, or wildfire insurance_ is not  
| reasonably available to a substantial number of the owners of  
| insurable property located in _the area_ [ ~~that territory~~ ] because the  
| _area_ [ ~~territory~~ ] is subject to unusually frequent and severe damage  
| resulting from windstorms _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] hailstorms _, tornadoes, or_  
| _wildfires_.  
|  (c) If the association determines that windstorm and hail

| hail insurance _, tornado insurance, and wildfire insurance_  
| voluntarily to cover property located in a catastrophe area,  
| especially property located on the barrier islands of this state.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 2210.102(b), Insurance Code, is amended

|  SECTION 10. Sections 2210.202(a) and (b), Insurance Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) A person who has an insurable interest in insurable  
| property may apply to the association for insurance coverage  
| provided under the plan of operation and an inspection of the  
| property, subject to any rules established by the board of  
| directors and approved by the commissioner. The association shall  
| make insurance available to each applicant in the catastrophe area  
| whose property is insurable property but who, after diligent  
| efforts, is unable to obtain property insurance through the  
| voluntary market, as evidenced by one declination from an insurer  
| authorized to engage in the business of, and writing, property  
| insurance providing windstorm and hail coverage in the first tier  
| coastal counties _or tornado insurance or wildfire insurance in this_  
| _state_. For purposes of this section, "declination" has the meaning  
| assigned by the plan of operation and shall include a refusal to  
| offer coverage for the perils of windstorm and hail _, tornado, or_  
| _wildfire_ and the inability to obtain substantially equivalent  
| insurance coverage for the perils of windstorm and hail _, tornado,_

| simplified renewal process that allows for the acceptance of an  
| application for renewal coverage, and payment of premiums, from a  
| property and casualty agent or a person insured under this chapter.  
| An application for initial or renewal coverage must contain:  
|  (1) a statement as to whether the applicant has  
| submitted or will submit the premium in full from personal funds or,  
| if not, to whom a balance is or will be due; and  
|  (2) a statement that the agent acting on behalf of the  
| applicant possesses proof of the declination described by  
| Subsection (a) and _, with respect to windstorm and hail insurance,_  
| proof of flood insurance coverage or unavailability of that  
| coverage as described by Section 2210.203(a-1).  
|  SECTION 11. Section 2210.203(a-1), Insurance Code, is

| enlarged on or after September 1, 2009, and only for insurable  
| property located in areas designated by the commissioner.  
| Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if all or any part of the property  
| to which this subsection applies is located in Zone V or another  
| similar zone with an additional hazard associated with storm waves,  
| as defined by the National Flood Insurance Program, and if flood  
| insurance under that federal program is available, the association  
| may not issue an insurance policy for initial or renewal coverage  
| unless evidence that the property is covered by a flood insurance  
| policy is submitted to the association.  An agent offering or

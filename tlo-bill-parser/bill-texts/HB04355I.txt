|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 25.25, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (c-1) and amending Subsections (e) and (m) to read as  
| follows:  
|  _(c-1)_ _____The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief_  
| _appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order_  
| _changes in the appraisal roll or related appraisal records for the_  
| _current tax year and for either of the two preceding tax years to_  
| _correct an inaccuracy in the appraised value of the owner's_  
| _tangible personal property that is the result of an error or_  
| _omission in a rendition statement or property report filed under_  
| _Chapter 22 for the applicable tax year. The roll may not be changed_  
| _under this subsection for any tax year in which:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the property owner failed to timely file the_  
| _rendition statement or property report in accordance with Section_  
| _22.23 and was assessed a penalty under Section 22.28;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the property was the subject of a protest brought_  
| _by the property owner under Chapter 41, a hearing on the protest was_  
| _conducted in which the owner offered evidence or argument, and the_  
| _appraisal review board made a determination of the protest on the_  
| _merits;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the property was the subject of a previous motion_  
| _filed by the property owner under this section and the chief_  
| _appraiser and the owner agreed to the correction, the appraisal_  
| _review board determined the motion, or the appraisal review board_  
| _determined that the owner forfeited the right to a final_  
| _determination of the motion for failing to comply with the_  
| _prepayment requirements of Section 25.26; or_  
|  _(4)_ _____the appraised value of the property was_  
| _established as a result of a written agreement between the property_  
| _owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district._  
|  (e) If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not  
| agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the  
| motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c) _,_  
| _(c-1),_ or (d) is entitled on request to a hearing on and a  
| determination of the motion by the appraisal review board. A party  
| bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or  
| errors that the motion is seeking to correct. Not later than 15  
| days before the date of the hearing, the board shall deliver written  
| notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the chief  
| appraiser, the property owner, and the presiding officer of the  
| governing body of each taxing unit in which the property is located.  
| The chief appraiser, the property owner, and each taxing unit are  
| entitled to present evidence and argument at the hearing and to  
| receive written notice of the board's determination of the motion.  
| The property owner is entitled to elect to present the owner's  
| evidence and argument before, after, or between the cases presented  
| by the chief appraiser and each taxing unit. A property owner who  
| files the motion must comply with the payment requirements of  
| Section 25.26 or forfeit the right to a final determination of the  
| motion.  
|  (m) The hearing on a motion under Subsection (c) _, (c-1),_ or  
| (d) shall be conducted in the manner provided by Subchapter C,  
| Chapter 41.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a motion to correct an appraisal roll filed on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A motion to correct an appraisal roll  
| filed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the motion was filed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

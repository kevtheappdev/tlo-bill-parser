| shall be informed [ ~~that the state is not seeking the death penalty~~

|  SECTION 2. Articles 1.13(a) and (b), Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) _Subject to Subsection (b), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] defendant in a  
| criminal prosecution for any offense _is entitled_ [ ~~other than a~~  
|  ~~capital felony case in which the state notifies the court and the~~  
|  ~~defendant that it will seek the death penalty shall have the right~~ ],  
| upon entering a plea, to waive the right of trial by jury,  
| conditioned, however, that, except as provided by Article 27.19,  
| the waiver must be made in person by the defendant in writing in  
| open court with the consent and approval of the court, and the  
| attorney representing the state. The consent and approval by the  
| court shall be entered of record on the minutes of the court, and

|  (1) authorize only the judges of the county courts,  
| statutory county courts, and district courts trying criminal cases  
| in the county, or the judges' designee, to appoint counsel for  
| indigent defendants in the county;  
|  (2) apply to each appointment of counsel made by a  
| judge or the judges' designee in the county;  
|  (3) ensure that each indigent defendant in the county  
| who is charged with a misdemeanor punishable by confinement or with  
| a felony and who appears in court without counsel has an opportunity  
| to confer with appointed counsel before the commencement of  
| judicial proceedings;  
|  (4) [ ~~require appointments for defendants in capital~~  
|  ~~cases in which the death penalty is sought to comply with any~~  
|  ~~applicable requirements under Articles 11.071 and 26.052;~~  
|  [ ~~(5)~~ ] ensure that each attorney appointed from a  
| public appointment list to represent an indigent defendant perform

| rules of ethics; and  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(6)~~ ] ensure that appointments are allocated  
| among qualified attorneys in a manner that is fair, neutral, and

| for indigent defendants in criminal cases is established by a  
| formal action in which two-thirds of the judges of the courts  
| designated under this subsection vote to establish the alternative  
| program.  An alternative program for appointing counsel in  
| misdemeanor and felony cases may be established in the manner  
| provided by this subsection by the judges of the county courts,  
| statutory county courts, and district courts trying criminal cases

| courts trying criminal cases in the county.  An alternative program  
| for appointing counsel in felony cases may be established in the  
| manner provided by this subsection by the judges of the district  
| courts trying criminal cases in the county.  In a county in which an  
| alternative program is established:  
|  (1) the alternative program may:  
|  (A) use a single method for appointing counsel or  
| a combination of methods; and  
|  (B) use a multicounty appointment list using a  
| system of rotation; and  
|  (2) the procedures adopted under Subsection (a) must  
| ensure that:  
|  (A) attorneys appointed using the alternative  
| program to represent defendants in misdemeanor cases punishable by  
| confinement:  
|  (i) meet specified objective  
| qualifications for that representation, which may be graduated  
| according to the degree of seriousness of the offense and whether  
| representation will be provided in trial court proceedings,  
| appellate proceedings, or both; and  
|  (ii) are approved by a majority of the  
| judges of the county courts and statutory county courts trying  
| misdemeanor cases in the county;  
|  (B) attorneys appointed using the alternative  
| program to represent defendants in felony cases:  
|  (i) meet specified objective  
| qualifications for that representation, which may be graduated  
| according to the degree of seriousness of the offense and whether  
| representation will be provided in trial court proceedings,  
| appellate proceedings, or both; and  
|  (ii) are approved by a majority of the  
| judges of the district courts trying felony cases in the county; _and_  
|  (C) [ ~~appointments for defendants in capital~~  
|  ~~cases in which the death penalty is sought comply with the~~  
|  ~~requirements of Article 26.052; and~~  
|  [ ~~(D)~~ ] appointments are reasonably and

| persons, not less than 50, as the court may order, to appear before  
| the court on a day named in the writ from whom the jury for the trial  
| of such case is to be selected. Where as many as one hundred jurors  
| have been summoned in such county for regular service for the week  
| in which such capital case is set for trial, the judge of the court  
| having jurisdiction of a capital case in which a motion for a  
| special venire has been made, shall grant or refuse such motion for  
| a special venire, and upon such refusal require the case to be tried  
| by regular jurors summoned for service in such county for the week  
| in which such capital case is set for trial and such additional  
| talesmen as may be summoned by the sheriff upon order of the court  
| as provided in Article 34.02 of this Code[ ~~, but the clerk of such~~

|  (b) In [ ~~non-capital~~ ] felony cases [ ~~and in capital cases in~~  
|  ~~which the State does not seek the death penalty~~ ], the State and  
| defendant shall each be entitled to ten peremptory challenges. If  
| two or more defendants are tried together each defendant shall be

| _life without parole_ [ ~~the punishment of death for crime,~~ ] in a  
| capital case[ ~~, where the State is seeking the death penalty~~ ];  
|  2. That _the juror_ [ ~~he~~ ] is related within the third  
| degree of consanguinity or affinity, as determined under Chapter  
| 573, Government Code, to the defendant; and

|  ~~applicable to the case on trial, of reasonable doubt, burden of~~  
|  ~~proof, return of indictment by grand jury, presumption of~~  
|  ~~innocence, and opinion. Then, on demand of the State or defendant,~~  
|  ~~either is entitled to examine each juror on voir dire individually~~  
|  ~~and apart from the entire panel, and may further question the juror~~  
|  ~~on the principles propounded by the court.~~ ]

| case be in the district court, call off the first twelve names on  
| the lists that have not been stricken. If the case be in the county  
| court, _the clerk_ [ ~~he~~ ] shall call off the first six names on the  
| lists that have not been stricken. Those whose names are called  
| shall be the jury.  
|  [ ~~(b)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~In a capital case in which the state seeks the
death~~  
|  ~~penalty, the court may direct that two alternate jurors be selected~~  
|  ~~and that the first fourteen names not stricken be called off by the~~  
|  ~~clerk. The last two names to be called are the alternate jurors.~~ ]

| or, as determined by the judge, becomes disabled from sitting at any  
| time before the charge of the court is read to the jury, the  
| remainder of the jury shall have the power to render the verdict;

| a finding of guilty is returned, it shall then be the responsibility  
| of the judge to assess the punishment applicable to the offense;  
| provided, however, that (1) in any criminal action where the jury  
| may recommend community supervision and the defendant filed his  
| sworn motion for community supervision before the trial began, and  
| (2) in other cases where the defendant so elects in writing before  
| the commencement of the voir dire examination of the jury panel, the  
| punishment shall be assessed by the same jury, except as provided in  
| Section 3(c) of this article and in Article 44.29.  If a finding of

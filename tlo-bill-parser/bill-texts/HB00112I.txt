|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to legislative review and approval of certain state agency  
| rules.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 2001, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 2001.0321 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___2001.0321._ _____LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OF CERTAIN PROPOSED_  
| _RULES REQUIRED. (a) This section applies only to a rule proposed_  
| _by a state agency:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the implementation and administration of which is_  
| _anticipated to have an economic impact of $20 million or more, as_  
| _determined by the agency; and_  
|  _(2) that is not an emergency rule._  
|  _(b)_ _____A state agency shall file, on the same day it files_  
| _notice with the secretary of state as required by Section 2001.023,_  
| _a copy of each proposed rule with the officer or employee with whom_  
| _bills are filed in each house of the legislature. After filing, the_  
| _proposed rule shall be referred to a standing committee in the same_  
| _manner as bills are referred, unless a house by rule provides for_  
| _another manner of referral of agency rules. Each proposed rule must_  
| _be referred to a standing committee before the 10th day after the_  
| _date the rule is filed with the appropriate officer or employee of_  
| _each house._  
|  _(c)_ _____Not later than the 30th day after the date a proposed_  
| _rule is referred to a committee, the committee shall consider the_  
| _rule at a committee meeting and vote on the rule. A proposed rule is_  
| _approved by the unanimous vote of the committee's full membership._  
| _If the committee does not approve a proposed rule by unanimous vote_  
| _of the committee's full membership, the rule is suspended. If a_  
| _proposed rule is suspended in committee, the committee shall, not_  
| _later than the third day after the date the rule is suspended:_  
|  _(1)_ _____notify the state agency that proposed the rule of_  
| _the suspension; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____file notice of the suspension with the secretary_  
| _of state for publication in the Texas Register._  
|  _(d)_ _____If a proposed rule is suspended in committee when the_  
| _legislature is in session, the chair of the committee shall give_  
| _written notice of the suspension to the presiding officer of the_  
| _appropriate house not later than the fifth day after the date the_  
| _rule is suspended. Not later than the 35th day after the date the_  
| _proposed rule is suspended in committee, the members of that house_  
| _shall vote on the rule. If a majority of members of that house vote_  
| _to approve the proposed rule, the rule is approved and the_  
| _committee's suspension terminates. If a majority of members of_  
| _that house do not vote to approve the proposed rule, the committee's_  
| _suspension remains in effect._  
|  _(e)_ _____If a proposed rule is suspended in committee when the_  
| _legislature is not in session, the secretary of state shall give_  
| _written notice of the suspension to the presiding officer of the_  
| _appropriate house during the first 10 days of the next regular_  
| _legislative session. Not later than the 30th day after the date the_  
| _notice is given, the members of that house shall vote on the_  
| _proposed rule. If a majority of members of that house vote to_  
| _approve the proposed rule, the rule is approved and the committee's_  
| _suspension terminates. If a majority of members of that house do_  
| _not vote to approve the proposed rule, the committee's suspension_  
| _remains in effect._  
|  _(f)_ _____Not later than the third day after the date a suspension_  
| _is terminated under Subsection (d) or (e), the presiding officer of_  
| _the appropriate house shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____notify the state agency that proposed the rule of_  
| _the suspension's termination; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____file notice of the termination with the secretary_  
| _of state for publication in the Texas Register._  
|  _(g)_ _____A state agency may adopt a proposed rule only if the_  
| _rule:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is approved by both committees to which it is_  
| _referred as provided by Subsection (c);_  
|  _(2)_ _____was suspended in committee in only one house of the_  
| _legislature, and that house later votes to approve the rule; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____was suspended in committee in both houses of the_  
| _legislature, and both houses later vote to approve the rule._  
|  _(h)_ _____During the time a proposed rule is suspended under this_  
| _section, the state agency that proposed the rule may not adopt a_  
| _rule or emergency rule containing the substance of the suspended_  
| _rule._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2001.0321, Government Code, as added by  
| this Act, applies only to a proposed state agency rule to which that  
| section applies and for which notice of the rule as proposed is  
| first published in the Texas Register under Section 2001.023,  
| Government Code, on or after the effective date of this Act.  A rule  
| to which Section 2001.0321, Government Code, as added by this Act,  
| applies and for which notice is published before the effective date  
| of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the notice was  
| published, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| legislative review or approval of state agency rules is approved by  
| the voters.  If that proposed constitutional amendment is not  
| approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to access to certain investigational drugs, biological  
| products, and devices that are in clinical trials by patients with  
| severe chronic diseases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a)  This Act shall be known as the "Medical  
| Freedom Act."  
|  (b) The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) the Right To Try Act, as added by Chapter 502 (H.B.  
| 21), Acts of the 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015, has had  
| tremendous success in saving the lives of many patients with a  
| terminal illness;  
|  (2) the process for approving the use of  
| investigational drugs, biological products, and devices by  
| patients without a terminal illness who need access to the drugs,  
| products, or devices continues to take many years in the United  
| States;  
|  (3) patients who are battling a severe chronic disease  
| that is debilitating or causes severe pain do not have the luxury of  
| waiting until an investigational drug, biological product, or  
| device receives final approval from the United States Food and Drug  
| Administration;  
|  (4) the standards of the United States Food and Drug  
| Administration for the use of investigational drugs, biological  
| products, and devices may deny the benefits of potentially  
| life-altering treatment to patients with a severe chronic disease;  
|  (5) patients with a severe chronic disease have a  
| fundamental right to attempt to pursue the preservation of their  
| state of life by accessing available investigational drugs,  
| biological products, and devices;  
|  (6) the use of available investigational drugs,  
| biological products, and devices is a decision that should be made  
| by a patient with a severe chronic disease in consultation with the  
| patient's physician and is not a decision to be made by the  
| government; and  
|  (7) the decision to use an investigational drug,  
| biological product, or device should be made with full awareness of  
| the potential risks, benefits, and consequences to a patient with a  
| severe chronic disease and the patient's family.  
|  (c) It is the intent of the legislature to allow patients  
| with a severe chronic disease to use potentially life-altering  
| investigational drugs, biological products, and devices.  
|  SECTION 2. Subtitle C, Title 6, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by adding Chapter 490 to read as follows:

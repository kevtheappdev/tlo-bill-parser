| unconstitutionality, preemption, or sovereign immunity, the  
| attorney general of this state, with the consent of the appropriate  
| local county or district attorney, shall take any actions necessary  
| on behalf of the state to defend the validity of the statute.  The

| save the statute from judicial invalidation.

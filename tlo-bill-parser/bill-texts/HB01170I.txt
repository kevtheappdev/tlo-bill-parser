| _suffer a loss in the hypothetical value of all assets under_  
| _management by the state retirement system as a result of having to_  
| _divest from listed companies under this chapter; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____an individual portfolio that uses a_  
| _benchmark-aware strategy would be subject to an aggregate expected_  
| _deviation from its benchmark as a result of having to divest from_  
| _listed companies under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____A state retirement system may cease divesting from a_  
| _listed company as provided by this section only to the extent_  
| _necessary to ensure that the state retirement system does not_

| _from a listed company under this section, the state retirement_  
| _system must provide a written report to the comptroller, the_

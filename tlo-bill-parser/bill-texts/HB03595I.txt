|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the modification of an order establishing the  
| conservatorship or possession of or access to a child after a  
| conservator's death.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 156, Family Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 156.106 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___156.106._ _____MODIFICATION OF ORDER BASED ON DEATH OF_  
| _CONSERVATOR. (a) The death of a person who is a conservator of a_  
| _child is a material and substantial change of circumstances_  
| _sufficient to justify a temporary order and modification of an_  
| _existing court order or portion of a decree that provides for the_  
| _appointment of a conservator or that sets the terms and conditions_  
| _of conservatorship or for the possession of or access to the child._  
|  _(b)_ _____Before modifying an order under Section 156.101 based on_  
| _a material and substantial change of circumstances described by_  
| _Subsection (a), the court must consider any term or condition of the_  
| _order or portion of a decree that denies possession of the child to_  
| _a parent or imposes restrictions or limitations on the parent's_  
| _right to possession of or access to the child. The court shall_  
| _include those restrictions or limitations in a modification of the_  
| _order if the court finds that the restrictions or limitations_  
| _continue to be in the best interest of the child._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies to a  
| suit for modification that is pending in a trial court on the  
| effective date of this Act or that is filed on or after that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| _code, effective January 1, 2017, which is $405,000_ [ ~~$200,000 per~~  
|  ~~year~~ ] for an eligible _member_ [ ~~participant~~ ] or _$270,000_ [
~~$150,000~~  
|  ~~per year~~ ] for an ineligible _member_ [ ~~participant~~ ]. _For
purposes of_  
| _this subsection, an eligible member is any employee who first_  
| _became a member before 1996 and an ineligible member is any other_  
| _member. The_ [ ~~These~~ ] dollar limits shall be [ ~~periodically~~ ]
adjusted  
| _annually for cost-of-living increases as provided by Section_  
| _401(a)(17) of the code_ [ ~~in accordance with guidelines provided by~~  
|  ~~the United States secretary of the treasury. For purposes of this~~  
|  ~~subsection, an eligible participant is any person who first became~~

| [ ~~has completed 20 years of service~~ ];  
|  (2) the earlier termination or partial termination of  
| the pension plan created by this Act, if it affects the member; or

| the code _and the regulations adopted under that section of the code,_  
| _including regulations governing the incidental death benefit_  
| _distribution requirements_.  
|  (j) _Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the_  
| _limitations on benefits imposed by Section 415 of the code and_  
| _Subsection (a) of this section must be adjusted each year to the_  
| _extent permitted by cost-of-living increases announced by the_  
| _secretary of the treasury under Section 415(d) of the code and_  
| _applicable law. A cost-of-living increase described by this_  
| _subsection applies to members who have terminated employment,_  
| _including members who have begun receiving benefits before the_  
| _effective date of the increase, and any benefits previously denied._  
| _Benefits paid to make up for benefits previously denied are_  
| _considered the delayed payment of benefits earned before retirement_  
| _and not extra compensation earned after retirement._ [ ~~To the extent~~  
|  ~~permitted by law, the board may adjust the benefits of retired~~  
|  ~~members and beneficiaries by increasing any retirement benefit that~~  
|  ~~was reduced because of Section 415 of the code. If Section 415 of~~  
|  ~~the code is amended to permit the payment of amounts previously~~  
|  ~~precluded under Section 415 of the code, the board may adjust the~~  
|  ~~benefits of retired members and beneficiaries, including the~~  
|  ~~restoration of benefits previously denied. Benefits paid under~~  
|  ~~this subsection are not considered as extra compensation earned~~  
|  ~~after retirement but as the delayed payment of benefits earned~~  
|  ~~before retirement.~~ ]

| (Article 6243o, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), are amended to read

|  ~~member or~~ ] retiree leaves a surviving spouse who is not entitled to  
| an annuity on the date of _the retiree's_ death under Subsection (g-1)  
| of this section _as the result of Subsection (g-3) of this section_  
| and _the deceased retiree has_ one or more dependent children, the

|  (g) _A child who is adopted after the date of retirement of_  
| _the member is not entitled to a death benefit annuity under this_  
| _Act._ A child who is born after the date of retirement of the member  
| is not entitled to a death benefit annuity under this Act unless the  
| retiree was married to the other parent of the child on the date of  
| retirement. A surviving spouse of a retiree whose status as a  
| surviving spouse resulted from a marriage after the date of the  
| retirement of the retiree is entitled to receive only the benefits,  
| if any, provided under Subsection (g-1) of this section or Section

| annuity paid under this _section_ [ ~~subsection~~ ] to a dependent child  
| as defined by Section 1.02(7)(B) of this Act may, at the discretion  
| of the board, be reduced to the extent of any state pension or aid,

|  Sec. 6.03. DEATH BENEFIT ANNUITY FOR SPOUSE _AND CHILDREN_ OF  
| MEMBER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY. (a) The death benefit annuity of a  
| surviving spouse _and any dependent child_ of a member of the fund who  
| is killed in the line of duty is governed by this section.  
|  (b) [ ~~The board shall consider the finding of a municipality~~  
|  ~~to which this Act applies that a member was killed in the line of~~  
|  ~~duty as a guideline for its determination in applying this~~  
|  ~~section.~~ ] On an application for survivor's benefits by a surviving  
| spouse or dependent child, the fund shall pay the normal benefits  
| payable under Section 6.02 of this Act. When a benefit is payable  
| under this section, the death benefit annuity shall be recomputed,  
| applying Subsection (c) of this section, and any deficiency payment  
| shall be paid to the eligible beneficiaries.  
|  (c) Notwithstanding the formulas for computing the total  
| amounts of annuities otherwise provided by this Act, if a member is  
| killed in the line of duty, the member's surviving spouse and  
| dependent children are entitled to a death benefit annuity equal  
| to _:_  
|  _(1)_ the total salary [ ~~of~~ ] the member _received during_  
| _the 12-month period before the date of the member's death, if the_  
| _member served 12 months or more before the date of the member's_

|  _(3)_ _____the average daily total salary the member received_  
| _before the date of the member's death multiplied by 360, if the_

| by Section 6.02 of this Act and is subject to the same  
| cost-of-living adjustments that apply to _annuities_ [ ~~pensions~~ ] for  
| service retirement.

| the marriage [ ~~or remarriage~~ ] takes place on or after October 1,  
| 1995.  
|  (b) _This subsection applies to a surviving spouse or_  
| _dependent child whose marriage under either statutory or common law_  
| _took place before October 1, 1995, and resulted in a termination of_  
| _benefits under the law in effect at the time of the marriage._  
| _Subject to Subsection (d) of this section and except as provided by_  
| _Subsection (e) of this section, if on_ [ ~~If after~~ ] October 1, 1995,

| successor statutes, before the member's death. _The date the_  
| _declaration of informal marriage is recorded under Section 2.404,_

| its own initiative, make a thorough investigation, determine the  
| facts as to the dependency with respect to an application for  
| benefits made under Subsection (a) of this section, and at any time,  
| on the request of any beneficiary or any contributor to the fund,  
| reopen any award made to any member or dependent of any member who  
| is receiving annuity payments under this section and discontinue  
| those payments as to all or any of them. [ ~~The findings of the board~~  
|  ~~under this section and all annuities granted under this section are~~

| _this section only if the member's beneficiary provides sufficient_  
| _evidence to the board to establish to the board's satisfaction_  
| _that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____an administrative appeal of the indefinite_  
| _suspension to the municipality was being actively pursued at the_

| payment under this section, the total death benefit annuity payable  
| [ ~~to the surviving spouse~~ ] under Section 6.02 of this Act is reduced  
| as provided by Subsection (j) of this section. The lump-sum  
| election does not affect the amount of a death benefit annuity

| of this Act _while a death benefit annuity is payable to the_  
| _surviving spouse_.  
|  SECTION 22. Chapter 824 (S.B. 817), Acts of the 73rd

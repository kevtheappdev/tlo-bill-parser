|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 571.020(c), (d), (e), and (f), Health  
| and Safety Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) An individual who commits an offense under this section  
| is subject on conviction to:  
|  (1) a fine of not less than _$100,000_ [ ~~$50~~ ] or more than

| violation;  
|  (2) confinement in jail for not more than two years for  
| each violation and each day of a continuing violation; or  
|  (3) both fine and confinement.  
|  (d) A person other than an individual who commits an offense  
| under this section is subject on conviction to a fine of not less  
| than _$100,000_ [ ~~$500~~ ] or more than _$250,000_ [ ~~$100,000~~ ] for
each  
| violation and each day of a continuing violation.  
|  (e) If it is shown on the trial of an individual that the  
| individual has previously been convicted of an offense under this  
| section, the offense is punishable by:  
|  (1) a fine of not less than _$250,000_ [ ~~$100~~ ] or more  
| than _$500,000_ [ ~~$50,000~~ ] for each violation and each day of a  
| continuing violation;  
|  (2) confinement in jail for not more than four years  
| for each violation and each day of a continuing violation; or

|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to

| offense committed before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For purposes of  
| this section, an offense was committed before the effective date of  
| this Act if any element of the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

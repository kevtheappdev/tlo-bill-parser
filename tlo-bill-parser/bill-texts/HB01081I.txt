| _appraised value of the owner's tangible personal property that is_  
| _the result of an error or omission in a rendition statement or_  
| _property report filed under Chapter 22 for the applicable tax year._  
| _The roll may not be changed under this subsection for any tax year_  
| _in which:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the property owner failed to timely file the_  
| _rendition statement or property report in accordance with Section_

| _merits; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____the appraised value of the property was_  
| _established as a result of a written agreement between the property_  
| _owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district._  
|  (e) If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not  
| agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the  
| motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c) _,_  
| _(c-1),_ or (d) is entitled on request to a hearing on and a  
| determination of the motion by the appraisal review board. A party  
| bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or  
| errors that the motion is seeking to correct. Not later than 15  
| days before the date of the hearing, the board shall deliver written  
| notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the chief  
| appraiser, the property owner, and the presiding officer of the  
| governing body of each taxing unit in which the property is located.  
| The chief appraiser, the property owner, and each taxing unit are  
| entitled to present evidence and argument at the hearing and to  
| receive written notice of the board's determination of the motion.  
| The property owner is entitled to elect to present the owner's  
| evidence and argument before, after, or between the cases presented  
| by the chief appraiser and each taxing unit. A property owner who  
| files the motion must comply with the payment requirements of

| filed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the motion was filed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

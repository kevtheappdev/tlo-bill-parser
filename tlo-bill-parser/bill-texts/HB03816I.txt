|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the regulatory analysis of rules proposed by the Texas  
| Commission on Environmental Quality.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2001.0225(a), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) This section applies only to a major environmental rule  
| adopted by a state agency _other than the Texas Commission on_  
| _Environmental Quality_ , the result of which is to:  
|  (1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the  
| rule is specifically required by state law;  
|  (2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless  
| the rule is specifically required by federal law;  
|  (3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or  
| contract between the state and an agency or representative of the  
| federal government to implement a state and federal program; or  
|  (4) adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the  
| agency instead of under a specific state law.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 382.051961(b), Health and Safety Code,  
| is amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) The commission may not adopt a new permit by rule or a  
| new standard permit or amend an existing permit by rule or an  
| existing standard permit relating to a facility to which this  
| section applies unless the commission:  
|  (1) conducts a regulatory analysis as provided by  
| Section _5.1032, Water_ [ ~~2001.0225, Government~~ ] Code;  
|  (2) determines, based on the evaluation of credible  
| air quality monitoring data, that the emissions limits or other  
| emissions-related requirements of the permit are necessary to  
| ensure that the intent of this chapter is not contravened,  
| including the protection of the public's health and physical  
| property;  
|  (3) establishes any required emissions limits or other  
| emissions-related requirements based on:  
|  (A) the evaluation of credible air quality  
| monitoring data; and  
|  (B) credible air quality modeling that is not  
| based on the worst-case scenario of emissions or other worst-case  
| modeling scenarios unless the actual air quality monitoring data  
| and evaluation of that data indicate that the worst-case scenario  
| of emissions or other worst-case modeling scenarios yield modeling  
| results that reflect the actual air quality monitoring data and  
| evaluation; and  
|  (4) considers whether the requirements of the permit  
| should be imposed only on facilities that are located in a  
| particular geographic region of the state.  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter D, Chapter 5, Water Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 5.1032 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___5.1032._ _____ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULES. (a) In this_  
| _section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Cost" means a reasonably identifiable,_  
| _significant, and direct or indirect negative economic effect._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Environmental benefit" means a reasonably_  
| _identifiable, significant, and direct effect, including a_  
| _quantifiable environmental, health, or economic effect, that is_  
| _expected to result from regulation of the pollutant or pollutants_  
| _targeted by an environmental rule._ ___The term does not include_  
| _incidental co-benefits expected to result from the implementation_  
| _of an environmental rule, including the reduction of pollutants_  
| _already regulated by separate environmental rules._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Environmental rule" means a rule the specific_  
| _intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to_  
| _human health from environmental exposure._  
|  _(4)_ _____"Small business" means a business that employs not_  
| _more than 250 individuals._  
|  _(b)_ _____Before adopting an environmental rule, the commission_  
| _shall conduct a regulatory analysis that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____identifies the problem the rule is intended to_  
| _address;_  
|  _(2)_ _____determines whether a new rule is necessary to_  
| _address the problem; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____considers the benefits and costs of the proposed_  
| _rule in relationship to state agencies, local governments, the_  
| _public, the regulated community, and the environment._  
|  _(c)_ _____When giving notice of an environmental rule, the_  
| _commission shall incorporate into the fiscal note required by_  
| _Section 2001.024, Government Code, a draft impact analysis_  
| _describing the anticipated effects of the proposed rule. The draft_  
| _impact analysis, at a minimum, must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____identify the problem the rule is intended to_  
| _address;_  
|  _(2)_ _____identify the environmental benefits that the_  
| _agency expects to result from implementation of and compliance with_  
| _the rule, including the projected level of reduction of pollutants_  
| _or contaminants in air, water, and soil media;_  
|  _(3)_ _____identify and describe the costs that the agency_  
| _expects that state agencies, local governments, the public, and the_  
| _affected regulated entities, other than small businesses, will_  
| _incur from implementation of and compliance with the rule; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____identify and describe in a separate economic_  
| _impact analysis the costs that the agency expects that small_  
| _businesses will incur from implementation of and compliance with_  
| _the rule._  
|  _(d)_ _____In identifying the environmental benefits of an_  
| _environmental rule under Subsection (c)(2), the commission shall_  
| _include the modeled improvement for the criteria pollutant design_  
| _value expected from implementation of the rule, if the rule will be_  
| _included in the state implementation plan under the federal Clean_  
| _Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)._  
|  _(e)_ _____After considering public comments submitted under_  
| _Section 2001.029, Government Code, and determining that a proposed_  
| _environmental rule should be adopted, the commission shall prepare_  
| _a final regulatory analysis that complies with Section 2001.033,_  
| _Government Code._  
|  _(f)_ _____A person who submitted a comment in accordance with_  
| _Section 2001.029, Government Code, may challenge the validity of an_  
| _environmental rule that is not proposed and adopted in strict_  
| _compliance with the procedural requirements of this section by_  
| _filing an action for declaratory judgment as provided by Section_  
| _2001.038, Government Code, not later than the 30th day after the_  
| _effective date of the rule. If the court determines that an_  
| _environmental rule was not proposed and adopted in strict_  
| _compliance with the procedural requirements of this section, the_  
| _rule is invalid._  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an environmental rule proposed by the Texas Commission on  
| Environmental Quality for which notice is given under Sections  
| 2001.023 and 2001.024, Government Code, on or after December 1,  
| 2019.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

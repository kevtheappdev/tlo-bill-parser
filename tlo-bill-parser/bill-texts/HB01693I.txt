|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to affidavits concerning cost and necessity of services.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 18.001, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, is amended by amending Subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f)  
| and adding Subsections (d-1), (g), (h), and (i) to read as follows:  
|  (b) Unless a controverting affidavit is served as provided  
| by this section, an affidavit that the amount a person charged for a  
| service was reasonable at the time and place that the service was  
| provided and that the service was necessary is sufficient evidence  
| to support a finding of fact by judge or jury that the amount  
| charged was reasonable or that the service was necessary. _The_  
| _affidavit is not evidence of and does not support a finding of the_  
| _causation element of the cause of action that is the basis for the_  
| _civil action._  
|  (c) The affidavit must:  
|  (1) be taken before an officer with authority to  
| administer oaths;  
|  (2) be made by:  
|  (A) the person who provided the service; or  
|  (B) the person in charge of records _for the_  
| _provider_ showing the service provided and charge made; and  
|  (3) include an itemized statement of the service and  
| charge.  
|  (d) The party offering the affidavit in evidence or the  
| party's attorney must serve a copy of the affidavit on each other  
| party to the case _not later than the earlier of:_  
|  _(1) 90_ [ ~~at least 30~~ ] days before the _date_ [ ~~day on which~~  
|  ~~evidence is first presented at~~ ] the trial _commences; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the date the offering party must designate any_  
| _expert witnesses under a scheduling order_ [ ~~of the case~~ ].  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The party offering the affidavit in evidence or the_  
| _party's attorney must file notice with the clerk of the court, not_  
| _later than the latest date for serving a copy of the affidavit under_  
| _Subsection (d), that the party or the attorney served a copy of the_  
| _affidavit in accordance with this section._ Except as provided by  
| the Texas Rules of Evidence, [ ~~the records attached to~~ ] the  
| affidavit _is_ [ ~~are~~ ] not required to be filed with the clerk of the  
| court before the trial commences.  
|  (e) A party intending to controvert a claim reflected by the  
| affidavit must serve a copy of the counteraffidavit on each other  
| party or the party's attorney of record _by the earlier of_ :  
|  (1) _60 days before the date the trial commences_ [ ~~not~~  
|  ~~later than:~~  
|  [ ~~(A)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~30 days after the day the party receives a~~  
|  ~~copy of the affidavit; and~~  
|  [ ~~(B)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~at least 14 days before the day on which~~  
|  ~~evidence is first presented at the trial of the case~~ ]; or  
|  (2) _the date the controverting party must designate_  
| _expert witnesses under a scheduling order_ [ ~~with leave of the court,~~  
|  ~~at any time before the commencement of evidence at trial~~ ].  
|  (f) The counteraffidavit must give reasonable notice of the  
| basis on which the party serving it intends at trial to controvert  
| the claim reflected by the initial affidavit and must be taken  
| before a person authorized to administer oaths.  The  
| counteraffidavit must be made by a person who is qualified, by  
| knowledge, skill, experience, training, education, or other  
| expertise, to testify in contravention of all or part of any of the  
| matters contained in the initial affidavit.  _The counteraffidavit_  
| _may not be used to controvert the causation element of the cause of_  
| _action that is the basis for the civil action._  
|  _(g)_ _____Not later than the last date for serving a copy of the_  
| _counteraffidavit under Subsection (e), the party offering the_  
| _counteraffidavit in evidence or the party's attorney must file_  
| _written notice with the clerk of the court that the party or_  
| _attorney served a copy of the counteraffidavit in accordance with_  
| _this section._  
|  _(h)_ _____If continuing services are provided after a relevant_  
| _deadline under this section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a party may supplement an affidavit served by the_  
| _party under Subsection (b) on or before the 30th day before the date_  
| _trial commences; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a party that served a counteraffidavit under_  
| _Subsection (e) may supplement the counteraffidavit on or before the_  
| _14th day before the date trial commences._  
|  _(i)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsections (d), (d-1), (e), (g), and_  
| _(h), a deadline under this section may be altered by all parties to_  
| _an action by agreement or with leave of the court._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an action commenced on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An action commenced before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law applicable to the action immediately before the  
| effective date of this Act, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

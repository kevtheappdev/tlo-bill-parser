|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the deferral or abatement of the collection of ad  
| valorem taxes on an appreciating residence homestead.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 33.065(a), (f), and (g), Tax Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) An individual is entitled to defer _collection of a tax_  
| or abate a suit to collect a delinquent tax imposed on the portion  
| of the appraised value of property the individual owns and occupies  
| as the individual's residence homestead that exceeds the sum of:  
|  (1) 105 percent of the appraised value of the property  
| for the preceding year; and  
|  (2) the market value of all new improvements to the  
| property.  
|  (f) If the collection of [ ~~delinquent~~ ] taxes on the property  
| was deferred in a prior tax year and the sum of the amounts  
| described by Subsections (a)(1) and (2) exceeds the appraised value  
| of the property for the current tax year, the amount of taxes the  
| collection of which may be deferred is reduced by the amount  
| calculated by multiplying the taxing unit's tax rate for the  
| current year by the amount by which that sum exceeds the appraised  
| value of the property.  
|  (g) A tax lien remains on the property and interest  
| continues to accrue during the period collection of [ ~~delinquent~~ ]  
| taxes is deferred or abated under this section. The annual interest  
| rate during the deferral or abatement period is _five_ [ ~~eight~~ ]  
| percent instead of the rate provided by Section 33.01. Interest and  
| penalties that accrued or that were incurred or imposed under  
| Section 33.01 or 33.07 before the date the individual files the  
| deferral affidavit under Subsection (c) or the date the judgment  
| abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are preserved. A  
| penalty is not incurred [ ~~on the delinquent taxes for which~~  
|  ~~collection is deferred or abated~~ ] during a deferral or abatement  
| period. The additional penalty under Section 33.07 may be imposed  
| and collected only if the [ ~~delinquent~~ ] taxes for which collection  
| is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 91st day  
| after the date the deferral or abatement period expires. A plea of  
| limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against  
| the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as  
| provided by this section.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 33.065(g), Tax Code, as amended by this  
| Act, applies only to interest that accrues during a deferral or  
| abatement period on or after the effective date of this Act,  
| regardless of whether the deferral or abatement period began before  
| that date or begins on or after that date. Interest that accrued  
| during a deferral or abatement period before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect when the interest accrued,  
| and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

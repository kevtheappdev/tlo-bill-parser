|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the consideration of the views of a close relative of a  
| deceased victim regarding the imposition of the death penalty in a  
| capital case.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2(a)(1), Article 37.071, Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (1) If a defendant is tried for a capital offense in  
| which the state seeks the death penalty, on a finding that the  
| defendant is guilty of a capital offense, the court shall conduct a  
| separate sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant  
| shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.  
| The proceeding shall be conducted in the trial court and, except as  
| provided by Article 44.29(c) [ ~~of this code~~ ], before the trial jury  
| as soon as practicable. In the proceeding, evidence may be  
| presented by the state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel  
| as to any matter that the court _considers_ [ ~~deems~~ ] relevant to  
| sentence, including evidence of the defendant's background or  
| character or the circumstances of the offense that mitigates  
| against the imposition of the death penalty _and evidence of the_  
| _views of a close relative of a deceased victim, as defined by_  
| _Article 56.01, regarding the imposition of the death penalty in the_  
| _case_. This subdivision _does_ [ ~~shall~~ ] not [ ~~be construed to~~ ]
authorize  
| the introduction of any evidence secured in violation of the  
| Constitution of the United States or of the State of Texas. The  
| state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel shall be  
| permitted to present argument for or against sentence of death. The  
| introduction of evidence of extraneous conduct is governed by the  
| notice requirements of Section 3(g), Article 37.07. The court, the  
| attorney representing the state, the defendant, or the defendant's  
| counsel may not inform a juror or a prospective juror of the effect  
| of a failure of a jury to agree on issues submitted under Subsection  
| (c) or (e).  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2(d), Article 37.071, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) The court shall charge the jury that:  
|  (1) in deliberating on the issues submitted under  
| Subsection (b) [ ~~of this article~~ ], it shall consider all evidence  
| admitted at the guilt or innocence stage and the punishment stage,  
| including evidence of the defendant's background or character or  
| the circumstances of the offense that militates for or mitigates  
| against the imposition of the death penalty _and evidence of the_  
| _views of a close relative of a deceased victim, as defined by_  
| _Article 56.01, regarding the imposition of the death penalty in the_  
| _case_ ;  
|  (2) it may not answer any issue submitted under  
| Subsection (b) of this article "yes" unless it agrees unanimously  
| and it may not answer any issue "no" unless 10 or more jurors agree;  
| and  
|  (3) members of the jury need not agree on what  
| particular evidence supports a negative answer to any issue  
| submitted under Subsection (b) [ ~~of this article~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. Section 2(e)(1), Article 37.071, Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (1) The court shall instruct the jury that if the jury  
| returns an affirmative finding to each issue submitted under  
| Subsection (b), it shall answer the following issue:  
|  Whether, taking into consideration all of the evidence,  
| including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's  
| character and background, [ ~~and~~ ] the personal moral culpability of  
| the defendant, _and the views of a close relative of a deceased_  
| _victim, as defined by Article 56.01, regarding the imposition of_  
| _the death penalty in the case,_ there is a sufficient mitigating  
| circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life  
| imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be  
| imposed.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a criminal proceeding that commences on or after the effective  
| date of this Act. A criminal proceeding that commenced before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the proceeding commenced, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

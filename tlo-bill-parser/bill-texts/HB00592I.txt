| mail to each bank _or credit union_ located in the district and, if  
| desired, to other banks _or credit unions_ , a notice stating the time

| use requests for proposals, the district shall state the selection  
| criteria, including the factors specified under Section 45.207(c),  
| in the request for proposals and shall select the proposal that  
| offers the best value to the district based on the evaluation and  
| ranking of each submitted proposal in relation to the stated  
| selection criteria.  A district may negotiate with the bank _or_  
| _credit union_ that submits the highest-ranked proposal to determine  
| any terms of the proposed depository contract other than the  
| interest rates proposed.  
|  SECTION 8. Sections 45.207(a), (a-1), (b), and (c),  
| Education Code, are amended to read as follows:

| the bank _or credit union_ that submits the highest bid or the  
| highest-ranked proposal, as determined under Subsection (c),

| Subsection (a-1) if:

| interest rates allowed by law by the Board of Governors of the  
| Federal Reserve System and the Board of Directors of the Federal  
| Deposit Insurance Corporation _or the National Credit Union_  
| _Administration Board, as applicable_ ; and  
|  (3) the tying bids or proposals are otherwise equal in  
| the judgment and discretion of the board of trustees of the  
| district.  
|  (a-1) In the case of tying bids or proposals, the board of  
| trustees may award the depository contract by:  
|  (1) determining by lot which of the banks _or credit_  
| _unions_ submitting the tying bids or proposals will receive the  
| contract; or  
|  (2) awarding a contract to each of the banks _or credit_  
| _unions_ submitting the tying bids or proposals.  
|  (b) The board of trustees may, during the period of the  
| contract, determine the amount of funds to be deposited in each  
| depository bank _or credit union_ and determine the account services  
| offered in the bid or proposal form that are to be provided by each  
| bank _or credit union_ in its capacity as school district depository.  
| All funds received by the district from or through the agency shall  
| be deposited, at the district's option, in one depository bank _or_  
| _credit union_ or invested in a public funds investment pool created  
| under Chapter 791, Government Code, to be designated by the  
| district.  
|  (c) The board of trustees of the school district shall at a  
| regular or special meeting consider in accordance with this  
| subsection each bid or proposal received. In determining the  
| highest and best bid or the highest-ranked proposal, or in case of  
| tying bids or proposals the highest and best tying bids or  
| proposals, the board of trustees shall consider:  
|  (1) the interest rate bid or proposed on time  
| deposits;  
|  (2) charges for keeping district accounts, records,  
| and reports and furnishing checks;  
|  (3) the ability of the bank _or credit union_ submitting  
| the bid or proposal to provide the necessary services and perform  
| the duties as school district depository; and  
|  (4) any other matter that in the judgment of the board  
| of trustees would be to the best interest of the school district.  
|  SECTION 9. Sections 45.208(a), (b), and (f), Education  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) _Each_ [ ~~The~~ ] bank or _credit union_ [ ~~banks~~ ] selected as _a_  
| [ ~~the~~ ] depository [ ~~or depositories~~ ] and the school district shall  
| enter into a depository contract [ ~~or contracts~~ ], bond [ ~~or bonds~~
],  
| or other necessary _instrument_ [ ~~instruments~~ ] setting forth the  
| duties and agreements pertaining to the depository, in a form and  
| with the content prescribed by the State Board of Education.  The  
| parties shall attach to the contract and incorporate by reference  
| the bid or proposal of the depository.  
|  (b) _Each_ [ ~~The~~ ] depository bank _or credit union_ shall attach  
| to the contract and file with the school district a bond in an  
| initial amount equal to the estimated highest daily balance,  
| determined by the board of trustees of the district, of all deposits  
| that the school district will have in the depository during the term  
| of the contract, less any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance  
| Corporation _or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund_  
| insurance.  The bond must be payable to the school district and must  
| be signed by the depository bank _or credit union_ and by some surety  
| company authorized to do business in this state.  The depository  
| bank _or credit union_ shall increase the amount of the bond if the  
| board of trustees determines it to be necessary to adequately  
| protect the funds of the school district deposited with the  
| depository bank _or credit union_.  
|  (f) In lieu of the bond required under Subsection (b), _a_  
| [ ~~the~~ ] depository bank _or credit union_ may deposit or pledge, with  
| the school district or with a trustee designated by the school  
| district, approved securities in an amount sufficient to adequately  
| protect the funds of the school district deposited with _the_  
| depository bank _or credit union_.  A depository bank _or credit union_  
| may give a bond and deposit or pledge approved securities in an  
| aggregate amount sufficient to adequately protect the funds of the  
| school district deposited with the depository bank _or credit union_.  
| The school district shall designate from time to time the amount of  
| approved securities or the aggregate amount of the bond and  
| approved securities to adequately protect the district.  The  
| district may not designate an amount less than the balance of school  
| district funds on deposit with _a_ [ ~~the~~ ] depository bank _or credit_  
| _union_ from day to day, less any applicable Federal Deposit  
| Insurance Corporation _or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund_  
| insurance.  _A_ [ ~~The~~ ] depository bank _or credit union_ may substitute  
| approved securities on obtaining the approval of the school  
| district.  For purposes of this subsection, the approved securities  
| are valued at their market value.  
|  SECTION 10. Section 45.209, Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 45.209. INVESTMENT OF DISTRICT FUNDS. The school  
| district may provide in its bid or proposal blank for the right to  
| place on time deposits with _a bank or credit union_ [ ~~savings and loan~~  
|  ~~institutions~~ ] located in this state only funds that are fully  
| insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation _or the_  
| _National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund_.  A district may not  
| place on deposit with any _bank or credit union_ [ ~~savings and loan~~  
|  ~~institution~~ ] any bond or certificate of indebtedness proceeds as  
| provided by Section 45.102.  A depository bank _or credit union_ may  
| not be compelled without its consent to accept on time deposit any  
| bond proceeds under Section 45.102, but a depository bank _or credit_  
| _union_ may offer a bid or proposal of interest equaling the highest  
| bid or proposal of interest for the time deposit of the bond  
| proceeds tendered by another bank _or credit union_. If the  
| depository bank _or credit union_ equals the bid or proposal, it is  
| entitled to receive the bond proceeds on time deposit.  
|  SECTION 11. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  (a) Except as provided by Subsection (i), a state agency or  
| a political subdivision of the state may not provide notice by a  
| communication described by Section 30.06 _or 30.07_ , Penal Code, or  
| by any sign expressly referring to _either of those provisions_ [ ~~that~~

| carrying a handgun under the authority of this subchapter is  
| prohibited from entering or remaining on a premises or other place  
| owned _and occupied by the governmental entity_ or leased _to and_  
| _occupied_ by the governmental entity unless license holders are  
| prohibited from carrying a handgun on the premises or other place by  
| Section 46.03 or 46.035, Penal Code _, or other law_.  
|  (d) A resident of this state or a person licensed to carry a  
| handgun under this subchapter may file a complaint with the  
| attorney general that a state agency or political subdivision is in  
| violation of Subsection (a) if the resident or _license holder_  
| [ ~~person~~ ] provides the agency or subdivision a written notice that  
| describes the violation [ ~~and specific location of the sign found to~~  
|  ~~be in violation~~ ] and the agency or subdivision does not cure the  
| violation before the end of the third business day after the date of  
| receiving the written notice.  _The written notice provided under_  
| _this subsection must include a copy of any document alleged to be in_

| warranted, the attorney general must give the chief administrative  
| officer of the agency or political subdivision charged with the  
| violation a written notice that:

| violation; and  
|  (3) gives the agency or political subdivision 15 days

| subdivision was found liable by a court for previously violating  
| Subsection (a).

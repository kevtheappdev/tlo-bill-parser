|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the requirements for interlocal contracts.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 791.011(d), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (d) An interlocal contract must:  
|  (1) be authorized by the governing body of each party  
| to the contract unless a party to the contract is a municipally  
| owned electric utility _or a municipally owned water utility_ , in  
| which event the governing body may establish procedures for  
| entering into interlocal contracts that do not exceed $100,000  
| without requiring the approval of the governing body;  
|  (2) state the purpose, terms, rights, and duties of  
| the contracting parties; and  
|  (3) specify that each party paying for the performance  
| of governmental functions or services must make those payments from  
| current revenues available to the paying party.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an interlocal contract entered into on or after the effective date  
| of this Act. An interlocal contract entered into before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the contract was entered into, and the former law is continued  
| in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| is essential for the welfare of this state and for the preservation  
| of the liberties and rights of citizens. It is further grounded on

|  OBJECTIVE 5: Educators will prepare students to be  
| thoughtful, active citizens who have an appreciation for the basic

| increase the effectiveness of student learning, instructional  
| management, staff development, and administration.  
|  OBJECTIVE 11: The State Board of Education, the agency, and  
| the commissioner shall assist school districts and charter schools  
| in providing career and technology education to students.  
|  _OBJECTIVE 12: After obtaining a high school diploma, students_

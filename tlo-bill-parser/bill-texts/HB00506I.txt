|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the construction of nontolled frontage roads adjacent  
| to certain toll projects.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 372, Transportation Code,  
| is amended by adding Section 372.054 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___372.054._ _____CONSTRUCTION OF NONTOLLED FRONTAGE ROAD_  
| _REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN TOLL PROJECTS. (a) Except as provided by_  
| _Section 228.201, a toll project entity may not construct a toll_  
| _project along the route of a previously nontolled highway unless_  
| _the entity constructs at least one adjacent nontolled lane of_  
| _frontage road for each direction of travel of the toll project._  
|  _(b)_ _____The lanes of frontage road described by Subsection (a)_  
| _shall be maintained by the entity that had authority over the_  
| _previously nontolled highway along which the toll project is_  
| _constructed._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 372.054, Transportation Code, as added  
| by this Act, applies only to a toll project for which a contract for  
| financing, construction, or operation is entered into on or after  
| the effective date of this Act. A toll project for which a contract  
| was entered into before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law as it existed at the time the contract was entered into,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

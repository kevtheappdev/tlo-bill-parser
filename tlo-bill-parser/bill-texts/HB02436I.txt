|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the release on personal bond of certain defendants with  
| a mental illness or an intellectual disability.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 17.032(b), Code of Criminal Procedure,  
| as amended by Chapters 748 (S.B. 1326) and 950 (S.B. 1849), Acts of  
| the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, is reenacted to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Article 17.03(b), or a bond schedule  
| adopted or a standing order entered by a judge, a magistrate shall  
| release a defendant on personal bond unless good cause is shown  
| otherwise if:  
|  (1) the defendant is not charged with and has not been  
| previously convicted of a violent offense;  
|  (2) the defendant is examined by the local mental  
| health authority, local intellectual and developmental disability  
| authority, or another qualified mental health or intellectual  
| disability expert under Article 16.22;  
|  (3) the applicable expert, in a written assessment  
| submitted to the magistrate under Article 16.22:  
|  (A) concludes that the defendant has a mental  
| illness or is a person with an intellectual disability and is  
| nonetheless competent to stand trial; and  
|  (B) recommends mental health treatment or  
| intellectual disability services for the defendant, as applicable;  
|  (4) the magistrate determines, in consultation with  
| the local mental health authority or local intellectual and  
| developmental disability authority, that appropriate  
| community-based mental health or intellectual disability services  
| for the defendant are available in accordance with Section 534.053  
| or 534.103, Health and Safety Code, or through another mental  
| health or intellectual disability services provider; and  
|  (5) the magistrate finds, after considering all the  
| circumstances, a pretrial risk assessment, if applicable, and any  
| other credible information provided by the attorney representing  
| the state or the defendant, that release on personal bond would  
| reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court as required  
| and the safety of the community and the victim of the alleged  
| offense.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 17.032(c), Code of Criminal Procedure,  
| as amended by Chapters 748 (S.B. 1326) and 950 (S.B. 1849), Acts of  
| the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, is reenacted and  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) The magistrate, unless good cause is shown for not  
| requiring treatment _or services_ , shall require as a condition of  
| release on personal bond under this article that the defendant  
| submit to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment or  
| intellectual disability services as recommended by the local mental  
| health authority, local intellectual and developmental disability  
| authority, or another qualified mental health or intellectual  
| disability expert if the defendant's:  
|  (1) mental illness or intellectual disability is  
| chronic in nature; or  
|  (2) ability to function independently will continue to  
| deteriorate if the defendant _does not receive the recommended_  
| _treatment or services_ [ ~~is not treated~~ ].  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

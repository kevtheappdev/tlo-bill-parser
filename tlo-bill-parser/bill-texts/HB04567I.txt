| _payment required of each paying hospital may not exceed an amount_  
| _that, when added to the amount of the mandatory payments required_

| _291A.103(c)(1), and to pay for indigent programs, except that the_

| _valorem taxes._  
|  _Sec._ ___291A.154._ _____PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE. (a) The purpose of this chapter is to generate revenue_  
| _by collecting from institutional health care providers a mandatory_  
| _payment to be used to provide the nonfederal share of a Medicaid_  
| _supplemental payment program._

| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_

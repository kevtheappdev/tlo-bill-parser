|  SECTION 2. (a) Section 11.42(c), Tax Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) An exemption authorized by Section 11.13(c) or (d),  
| 11.132, 11.133, [ ~~or~~ ] 11.134 _, or 11.136_ is effective as of January 1  
| of the tax year in which the person qualifies for the exemption and  
| applies to the entire tax year.  
|  (b) Section 11.43(c), Tax Code, is reenacted and amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) An exemption provided by Section 11.13, 11.131, 11.132,  
| 11.133, 11.134, _11.136,_ 11.17, 11.18, 11.182, 11.1827, 11.183,

| 11.231, 11.254, 11.27, 11.271, 11.29, 11.30, 11.31, or 11.315, once  
| allowed, need not be claimed in subsequent years, and except as  
| otherwise provided by Subsection (e), the exemption applies to the  
| property until it changes ownership or the person's qualification  
| for the exemption changes. However, except as provided by  
| Subsection (r), the chief appraiser may require a person allowed  
| one of the exemptions in a prior year to file a new application to  
| confirm the person's current qualification for the exemption by  
| delivering a written notice that a new application is required,  
| accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person  
| previously allowed the exemption. If the person previously allowed  
| the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief appraiser may  
| not cancel the exemption due to the person's failure to file the new  
| application unless the chief appraiser complies with the  
| requirements of Subsection (q), if applicable.  
|  (c) Section 11.431(a), Tax Code, is reenacted and amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) The chief appraiser shall accept and approve or deny an  
| application for a residence homestead exemption, including an  
| exemption under Section 11.131 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.132 _, or 11.136_ for the  
| residence homestead of a _Severely Disabled Veteran_ or the surviving  
| spouse of a _Severely Disabled Veteran_ , an exemption under Section  
| 11.133 for the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of a  
| member of the armed services of the United States who is killed in  
| action, or an exemption under Section 11.134 for the residence  
| homestead of the surviving spouse of a first responder who is killed  
| or fatally injured in the line of duty, after the deadline for  
| filing it has passed if it is filed not later than two years after  
| the delinquency date for the taxes on the homestead.  
|  (d) Section 26.10(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead  
| exemption under Section 11.13(c) or (d), 11.132, 11.133, [ ~~or~~ ]  
| 11.134 _, or 11.136_ applicable to a property on January 1 of a year  
| terminated during the year and if the owner of the property  
| qualifies a different property for one of those residence homestead  
| exemptions during the same year, the tax due against the former  
| residence homestead is calculated by:  
|  (1) subtracting:  
|  (A) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner qualified for the residence homestead exemption for the  
| entire year; from  
|  (B) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner not qualified for the residence homestead exemption  
| during the year;  
|  (2) multiplying the remainder determined under  
| Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and  
| the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the  
| date the exemption terminated; and  
|  (3) adding the product determined under Subdivision  
| (2) and the amount described by Subdivision (1)(A).  
|  SECTION 3. Section 11.43(k), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (k) A person who qualifies for an exemption authorized by  
| Section 11.13(c) or (d) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.132 _, or 11.136_ must apply for
the  
| exemption no later than the first anniversary of the date the person  
| qualified for the exemption.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 26.1127, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 26.1127. CALCULATION OF TAXES ON [ ~~DONATED~~ ] RESIDENCE

| provided by Section 26.10(b), if at any time during a tax year  
| property is owned by an individual who qualifies for an exemption  
| under Section 11.132 _or 11.136_ , the amount of the tax due on the  
| property for the tax year is calculated as if the individual  
| qualified for the exemption on January 1 and continued to qualify  
| for the exemption for the remainder of the tax year.  
|  (b) If an individual qualifies for an exemption under  
| Section 11.132 _or 11.136_ with respect to the property after the  
| amount of the tax due on the property is calculated and the effect  
| of the qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the  
| property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall recalculate the  
| amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll. If  
| the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been  
| paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the individual  
| in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the  
| individual's authorized agent. If the tax on the property has been  
| paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the  
| individual who paid the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded  
| the tax due.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 31.031(a), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) This section applies only to:  
|  (1) an individual who is:

| amended to read as follows:  
|  (2) "Local government" means:  
|  (A) a municipality adjacent to _or within twenty_  
| _miles of_ a military installation; and,  
|  (B) a county in which a United States military  
| installation is wholly or partly located.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 140.011(c), Local Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) For the purposes of this section, the amount of a local  
| government's lost ad valorem tax revenue for a fiscal year is  
| calculated by multiplying the ad valorem tax rate adopted by the  
| local government under Section 26.05, Tax Code, for the tax year in  
| which the fiscal year begins by _the sum of:_  
|  _(1)_ the total appraised value of all property located  
| in the local government that is _exempt_ [ ~~granted an exemption~~ ] from  
| taxation under Section 11.131, Tax Code, for that tax year _; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the total dollar amount of the portion of the_  
| _appraised value of all property located in the local government_  
| _that is exempt from taxation under Section 11.136, Tax Code, for_  
| _that tax year_.  
|  SECTION 8. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for an ad valorem tax year that begins on or after the effective  
| date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 9. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| an exemption from ad valorem taxation of part of the market value of  
| the residence homestead of a _Severely Disabled Veteran_ or the  
| surviving spouse of a _Severely Disabled Veteran_ based on the  
| disability rating of the veteran and harmonizing certain related  
| provisions of the constitution is approved by the voters. If that  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

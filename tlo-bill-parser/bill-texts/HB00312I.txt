| Texas Constitution, each commissioners court shall order the  
| changes before October 1 of the year in which the redistricting is  
| done.

| to read as follows:  
|  (e) The legislature, the Judicial Districts Board, or the  
| _Texas_ [ ~~Legislative~~ ] Redistricting _Commission_ [ ~~Board~~ ] may not  
| redistrict the judicial districts to provide for any judicial  
| district smaller in size than an entire county except as provided by  
| this subsection. Judicial districts smaller in size than the  
| entire county may be created subsequent to a general election in  
| which a majority of the persons voting on the proposition adopt the  
| proposition "to allow the division of ____________________ County  
| into judicial districts composed of parts of ____________________  
| County." A redistricting plan may not be proposed or adopted by the

| a future action by the voters of any county.

| sessions of the legislature and shall exercise its reapportionment  
| powers only in the interims between regular legislative sessions.  
| Meetings of the board shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter  
| 551, except as otherwise provided by this subchapter. A  
| reapportionment may not be ordered in the interim immediately  
| following a regular session of the legislature in which a valid and  
| subsisting statewide reapportionment of judicial districts is  
| enacted by the legislature. Unless the legislature enacts a  
| statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following each  
| federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than  
| the first Monday of June of the third year following the year in  
| which the federal decennial census is taken to make a statewide  
| reapportionment of the districts. The board shall complete its  
| work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of  
| state not later than August 31 of the same year. If the Judicial  
| Districts Board fails to make a statewide apportionment by that  
| date, the _Texas_ [ ~~Legislative~~ ] Redistricting _Commission_ [ ~~Board~~
]  
| established by Article III, Section _28a_ [ ~~28~~ ], of the Texas  
| Constitution shall make a statewide reapportionment of the judicial  
| districts not later than the _90th_ [ ~~150th~~ ] day after the final day  
| for the Judicial Districts Board to make the reapportionment, and  
| that apportionment takes effect as provided by Sections 24.948 and  
| 24.949.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 2058.002(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:

| [ ~~28~~ ], of the Texas Constitution may officially recognize or act on a  
| federal decennial census before September 1 of the year after the  
| calendar year during which the census was taken.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect January 1, 2021, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, establishing the Texas Redistricting  
| Commission to redistrict the Texas Legislature and Texas  
| congressional districts and revising procedures for redistricting  
| is approved by the voters. If that proposed constitutional  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

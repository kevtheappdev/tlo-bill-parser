| _25.25, as applicable; or_  
|  (2) an order of the comptroller issued as provided by

| _may, in lieu of dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,_  
| _remand the action to the appraisal review board with instructions_  
| _to allow the property owner an opportunity to cure the property_  
| _owner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies._  
|  _(c)_ _____An action remanded to the appraisal review board under_

| _the protest or motion and issue a written decision determining the_

| _jurisdiction on the basis of the property owner's failure to_  
| _exhaust administrative remedies._  
|  _(e)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (b), on agreement of each_  
| _party to the appeal and with the approval of the court, the parties_  
| _to the appeal may waive remand of the action to the appraisal review_

| _If the parties waive remand of the action under this subsection,_  
| _each party is considered to have exhausted the party's_  
| _administrative remedies._  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an appeal under Chapter 42, Tax Code, that is filed on or after  
| the effective date of this Act. An appeal under Chapter 42, Tax  
| Code, that is filed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the appeal is filed, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

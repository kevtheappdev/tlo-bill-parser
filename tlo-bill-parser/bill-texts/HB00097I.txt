|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the eligibility of land for appraisal for ad valorem tax  
| purposes as qualified open-space land.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 23.51(1) and (2), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (1) "Qualified open-space land" means land that is  
| currently devoted principally to agricultural use to the degree of  
| intensity generally accepted in the area and that has been devoted  
| principally to agricultural use or to production of timber or  
| forest products for five of the preceding seven years or land that  
| is used principally as an ecological laboratory by a public or  
| private college or university. _A chief appraiser shall distinguish_  
| _between the degree of intensity required for various agricultural_  
| _production methods, including organic, sustainable, pastured_  
| _poultry, rotational grazing, and other uncommon production methods_  
| _or systems._ Qualified open-space land includes all appurtenances  
| to the land.  For the purposes of this subdivision, appurtenances to  
| the land means private roads, dams, reservoirs, water wells,  
| canals, ditches, terraces, and other reshapings of the soil,  
| fences, and riparian water rights.  Notwithstanding the other  
| provisions of this subdivision, land that is currently devoted  
| principally to wildlife management as defined by Subdivision (7)(B)  
| or (C) to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area  
| qualifies for appraisal as qualified open-space land under this  
| subchapter regardless of the manner in which the land was used in  
| any preceding year.  
|  (2) "Agricultural use" includes but is not limited to  
| the following activities:  cultivating the soil, producing crops  
| for human food, animal feed, or planting seed or for the production  
| of fibers; _producing fruits and vegetables;_ floriculture,  
| viticulture, and horticulture; raising or keeping livestock;  
| raising or keeping exotic animals for the production of human food  
| or of fiber, leather, pelts, or other tangible products having a  
| commercial value; planting cover crops or leaving land idle for the  
| purpose of participating in a governmental program, provided the  
| land is not used for residential purposes or a purpose inconsistent  
| with agricultural use; and planting cover crops or leaving land  
| idle in conjunction with normal crop or livestock rotation  
| procedure.  The term also includes the use of land to produce or  
| harvest logs and posts for the use in constructing or repairing  
| fences, pens, barns, or other agricultural improvements on adjacent  
| qualified open-space land having the same owner and devoted to a  
| different agricultural use.  The term also includes the use of land  
| for wildlife management.  The term also includes the use of land to  
| raise or keep bees for pollination or for the production of human  
| food or other tangible products having a commercial value, provided  
| that the land used is not less than 5 or more than 20 acres.  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter D, Chapter 23, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 23.5215 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___23.5215._ _____GUIDELINES FOR UNCOMMON AGRICULTURAL USES._

| _Extension Service, individuals selected by the comptroller who_  
| _represent appraisal districts, and individuals selected by the_  
| _comptroller who represent affected producers, shall develop_  
| _guidelines for determining under what conditions the cumulative_  
| _effect of multiple agricultural uses of a tract of land meets the_  
| _degree of intensity generally accepted in the area._  
|  _(b)_ _____The comptroller, in consultation with the Texas A &M _  
| _AgriLife Extension Service, individuals selected by the_  
| _comptroller who represent appraisal districts, and individuals_

| _shall develop guidelines for determining under what conditions land_  
| _under 10 acres in size used for the production of fruits,_  
| _vegetables, poultry, hogs, sheep, or goats qualifies for appraisal_  
| _under this subchapter._ ___The guidelines must provide that land under_  
| _10 acres in size that qualifies for appraisal under this subchapter_  
| _solely on the basis of the guidelines developed under this section_  
| _may not subsequently qualify under Section 23.51(7) for appraisal_  
| _under this subchapter if the owner changes the use of the land to_  
| _wildlife management._  
|  _(c)_ _____The guidelines developed under this section may include_  
| _recordkeeping requirements consistent with normal practices of_  
| _agricultural operations._  
|  _(d)_ _____The comptroller in developing guidelines under this_  
| _section may consider the following factors:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the financial investment of a producer in an_  
| _agricultural use of a tract of land;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the degree of active management of a producer in_  
| _the agricultural use of a tract of land;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the percentage of a tract of land used by a_  
| _producer for agricultural uses; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____any other factor the comptroller considers_  
| _appropriate._

| _districts, shall provide educational resources to chief appraisers_

| _poultry._  
|  SECTION 3. Not later than September 1, 2020, the  
| comptroller shall distribute the guidelines required by Section

| for ad valorem tax purposes for a tax year that begins on or after  
| January 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  _(4)_ _____for property described by Subdivision (1)(A), is_  
| _the subject of a rendition statement or property report filed by the_  
| _property owner under Section 22.01 that demonstrates that the_  
| _property had taxable situs in the disaster area for the tax year in_  
| _which the disaster occurred._  
|  _(b)_ _____A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a_  
| _taxing unit of a portion of the appraised value of qualified_  
| _property that the person owns if the exemption is adopted by the_  
| _governing body of the taxing unit in the manner provided by law for_  
| _official action by the body._  
|  _(c)_ _____An exemption adopted by the governing body of a taxing_  
| _unit under this section must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____specify the disaster to which the exemption_  
| _pertains; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____be adopted not later than the 60th day after the_  
| _date the governor first declares territory in the taxing unit to be_  
| _a disaster area as a result of the disaster._  
|  _(d)_ _____A taxing unit the governing body of which adopts an_  
| _exemption under this section shall, not later than the seventh day_  
| _after the date the governing body adopts the exemption, notify the_  
| _chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the taxing unit_  
| _participates, the assessor for the taxing unit, and the comptroller_  
| _of the adoption of the exemption._  
|  _(e)_ _____On receipt of an application for the exemption_  
| _authorized by this section, the chief appraiser shall determine_  
| _whether any item of qualified property that is the subject of the_  
| _application is at least 15 percent damaged by the disaster and_  
| _assign to each such item of qualified property a damage assessment_  
| _rating of Level I, Level II, Level III, or Level IV, as appropriate,_  
| _as provided by Subsection (f). In determining the appropriate_  
| _damage assessment rating, the chief appraiser may rely on_  
| _information provided by a county emergency management authority,_  
| _the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any other source the_  
| _chief appraiser considers appropriate._  
|  _(f)_ _____The chief appraiser shall assign to an item of qualified_  
| _property:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a Level I damage assessment rating if the property_  
| _is at least 15 percent, but less than 30 percent, damaged, meaning_  
| _that the property suffered minimal damage and may continue to be_  
| _used as intended;_  
|  _(2)_ _____a Level II damage assessment rating if the_  
| _property is at least 30 percent, but less than 60 percent, damaged,_  
| _which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(1)(B),_  
| _means that the property has suffered only nonstructural damage,_  
| _including nonstructural damage to the roof, walls, foundation, or_  
| _mechanical components, and the waterline, if any, is less than 18_  
| _inches above the floor;_  
|  _(3)_ _____a Level III damage assessment rating if the_  
| _property is at least 60 percent damaged but is not a total loss,_  
| _which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(1)(B),_  
| _means that the property has suffered significant structural damage_  
| _requiring extensive repair due to the failure or partial failure of_  
| _structural elements, wall elements, or the foundation, or the_  
| _waterline is at least 18 inches above the floor; or_  
|  _(4)_ _____a Level IV damage assessment rating if the_  
| _property is a total loss, meaning that repair of the property is not_  
| _feasible._  
|  _(g)_ _____Subject to Subsection (h), the amount of the exemption_  
| _authorized by this section for an item of qualified property is_  
| _determined by multiplying the appraised value, determined for the_

| _damage assessment rating;_

| _damage assessment rating._  
|  _(h)_ _____If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by_  
| _this section after the beginning of the tax year, the amount of the_  
| _exemption is calculated by multiplying the amount determined under_  
| _Subsection (g) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and_  
| _the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the tax_  
| _year after the day on which the governor first declares the area in_  
| _which the person's qualified property is located to be a disaster_  
| _area, including the day on which the governor makes the_  
| _declaration._  
|  _(i)_ _____If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by_  
| _this section after the amount of the tax due on the qualified_  
| _property is calculated and the effect of the qualification is to_  
| _reduce the amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor for_  
| _each taxing unit that has adopted the exemption shall recalculate_  
| _the amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll._  
| _If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not_  
| _been paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the_  
| _person in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the_  
| _person's authorized agent. If the tax on the property has been_  
| _paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the_  
| _person who paid the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the_  
| _tax due. No interest is due on an amount refunded under this_  
| _subsection._  
|  _(j)_ _____The exemption authorized by this section expires as to_  
| _an item of qualified property on January 1 of the first tax year in_

| accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person  
| previously allowed the exemption.  If the person previously allowed  
| the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief appraiser may

| _appraiser shall deliver a written notice of the approval,_  
| _modification, or denial to the applicant not later than the fifth_  
| _day after the date the chief appraiser makes the determination. The_  
| _notice must include the damage assessment rating assigned by the_  
| _chief appraiser to each item of qualified property that is the_  
| _subject of the application and a brief explanation of the_  
| _procedures for protesting the chief appraiser's determination. The_  
| _notice required under this subsection is in lieu of any notice that_  
| _would otherwise be required under Subsection (d)._

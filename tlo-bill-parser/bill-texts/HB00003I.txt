| is provided and children must walk along or cross a freeway or  
| expressway, an underpass, an overpass or a bridge, an uncontrolled  
| major traffic artery, an industrial or commercial area, or another  
| comparable condition. An area presents a high risk of violence if

| be made only in extreme hardship cases. A grant may not be made if  
| the students live within two miles of an approved school bus route.

| contract for instruction approved by the agency shall be reimbursed  
| based on the number of actual miles traveled times the district's  
| official extracurricular travel per mile rate as set by the board of  
| trustees and approved by the agency.  
|  (g) A school district or county that provides special  
| transportation services for eligible special education students is

| transportation to reimburse parents or their agents for  
| transporting eligible special education students. The mileage  
| allowed shall be computed along the shortest public road from the

| providing transportation services.  
|  (i) In the case of a district belonging to a county  
| transportation system, the district's transportation allotment for  
| purposes of determining a district's foundation school program  
| allocations is determined on the basis of the number of approved  
| daily route miles in the district [ ~~multiplied by the allotment per~~  
|  ~~mile to which the county transportation system is entitled~~ ].

| allotment under this section. The commissioner shall determine the  
| appropriate allotment.

| county provides transportation for an eligible student to and from  
| a child-care facility, as defined by Section 42.002, Human  
| Resources Code, or a grandparent's residence instead of the  
| student's residence, as authorized by Section 34.007[ ~~, if the~~  
|  ~~transportation is provided within the approved routes of the~~  
|  ~~district or county for the school the student attends~~ ].

| this section, provide a bus pass or card for another transportation  
| system to each student who is eligible to use the regular  
| transportation system of the district but for whom the regular  
| transportation system of the district is not a feasible method of  
| providing transportation. The commissioner by rule shall provide  
| procedures for a school district to provide bus passes or cards to  
| students under this subsection.  
|  _(m)_ _____A school district shall be reimbursed on a per-mile_  
| _basis for the cost of transporting a dual credit student to another_

| Education Code, are transferred to Subchapter E, Chapter 48,  
| Education Code, as added by this Act, redesignated as Sections  
| 48.201, 48.202, 48.203, and 48.204, Education Code, and amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. _48.201_ [ ~~42.301~~ ]. PURPOSE. The purpose of the _tier_  
| _two_ [ ~~guaranteed yield~~ ] component of the Foundation School Program  
| is to provide each school district with the opportunity to provide  
| the basic program and to supplement that program at a level of its  
| own choice. An allotment under this subchapter may be used for any  
| legal purpose other than capital outlay or debt service.  
|  Sec. _48.202_ [ ~~42.302~~ ]. _TIER TWO_ ALLOTMENT. (a) Each school  
| district is guaranteed a specified amount per weighted student in  
| state and local funds for each cent of tax effort over that required  
| for the district's local fund assignment up to the maximum level  
| specified in this subchapter. The amount of state support, subject  
| only to the maximum amount under Section _48.203_ [ ~~42.303~~ ], is  
| determined by the formula:  
| GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR  
| where:  
|  "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be  
| allocated to the district;  
|  "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local  
| funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is an  
| amount described by Subsection (a-1) or a greater amount for any  
| year provided by appropriation;  
|  "WADA" is the number of students in weighted average daily  
| attendance, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the school  
| district's allotments under Subchapters B and C[ ~~, less any~~  
|  ~~allotment to the district for transportation, any allotment under~~  
|  ~~Section 42.158 or 42.160, and 50 percent of the adjustment under~~  
|  ~~Section 42.102,~~ ] by the basic allotment for the applicable year;  
|  "DTR" is the district enrichment tax rate of the school  
| district, which is determined by subtracting the amounts specified  
| by Subsection (b) from the total amount of maintenance and  
| operations taxes collected by the school district for the  
| applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient  
| of the district's taxable value of property as determined under  
| Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable,  
| under Section _48.258_ [ ~~42.2521~~ ], divided by 100; and  
|  "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying  
| "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section _48.258_ [ ~~42.2521~~ ], divided by 100.  
|  (a-1) For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount  
| guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per  
| cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:  
|  (1) the _product of_ [ ~~greater of~~ ] the amount of district  
| tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax effort [ ~~that would~~  
|  ~~be~~ ] available to _a_ [ ~~the Austin Independent School District, as~~  
|  ~~determined by the commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative~~  
|  ~~Budget Board, if the reduction of the limitation on tax increases as~~  
|  ~~provided by Section 11.26(a-1), (a-2), or (a-3), Tax Code, did not~~  
|  ~~apply, or the amount of~~ ] district _with maintenance and operations_  
| tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax effort _equal to the_  
| _maximum amount provided per cent under Section 48.051(a) or (b)_  
| _multiplied by 160 percent_ [ ~~used for purposes of this subdivision in~~  
|  ~~the preceding school year~~ ], for the first _eight_ [ ~~six~~ ] cents by
which  
| the district's maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds the  
| _district's tier one tax_ rate [ ~~equal to the sum of the product of the~~  
|  ~~state compression percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516,~~  
|  ~~multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by~~  
|  ~~the district for the 2005 tax year and any additional tax effort~~  
|  ~~included in calculating the district's compressed tax rate under~~  
|  ~~Section 42.101(a-1)~~ ]; and

| _amount of district tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax_  
| _effort available to a district with maintenance and operations tax_  
| _revenue per weighted student per cent of tax effort equal to the_  
| _maximum amount provided per cent under Section 48.051(a) or (b)_  
| _multiplied by 80 percent_ [ ~~$31.95~~ ], for the district's maintenance  
| and operations tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort  
| described by Subdivision (1).  
|  (a-2) The limitation on district enrichment tax rate  
| ("DTR") under Section _48.203_ [ ~~42.303~~ ] does not apply to the  
| district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by  
| Subsection (a-1)(1).  
|  (b) In computing the district enrichment tax rate of a  
| school district, the total amount of maintenance and operations  
| taxes collected by the school district does not include the amount  
| of:  
|  (1) the district's local fund assignment under Section  
| _48.256_ [ ~~42.252~~ ]; or

| Tax Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as  
| if the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.  
|  (d) For purposes of this section, the total amount of  
| maintenance and operations taxes collected for an applicable school  
| year by a school district with alternate tax dates, as authorized by  
| Section 26.135, Tax Code, is the amount of taxes collected on or  
| after January 1 of the year in which the school year begins and not  
| later than December 31 of the same year.  
|  (e) For purposes of this section, school district taxes for  
| which credit is granted under former Subchapter D, Chapter 313, Tax  
| Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as if  
| the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.  
|  (f) _For a school year in which a school district's dollar_  
| _amount guaranteed level of state and local funds under Subsection_  
| _(a-1)(2) results in a greater amount of district tax revenue per_  
| _weighted student per cent of tax effort than for the preceding_  
| _school year, the school district shall reduce the district's tax_  
| _rate under Section 45.0032(b)(2) for that tax year to a rate that_  
| _results in the amount of district tax revenue per weighted student_  
| _per cent of tax effort available to the district for the preceding_  
| _year. A school district is not entitled to the amount equal to the_  
| _increase of district tax revenue described under this section_  
| _during the tax year in which the district must reduce the district's_  
| _tax rate. This subsection does not apply if the amount of state_  
| _funds for a school year specifically excludes the amount necessary_  
| _to provide the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local_  
| _funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort under Subsection_  
| _(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~If a school district imposes a maintenance and operations~~  
|  ~~tax at a rate greater than the rate equal to the product of the state~~  
|  ~~compression percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516,~~  
|  ~~multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by~~  
|  ~~the district for the 2005 tax year, the district is entitled to~~

|  Sec. _48.255_ [ ~~42.2516~~ ]. STATE COMPRESSION PERCENTAGE. (a)  
| In this title, "state compression percentage" means the percentage  
| of _the rate of $1.00 per $100 valuation of taxable property at which_  
| a school _district must levy a_ [ ~~district's adopted~~ ] maintenance and  
| operations _tax to receive the full amount of the tier one allotment_  
| _to which the district is entitled under this chapter._  
|  _(b) The_ [ ~~tax rate for the 2005 tax year that serves as the~~  
|  ~~basis for state funding. If the~~ ] state compression percentage is _:_  
|  _(1) 96 percent; or_  
|  _(2) a lower percentage set_ [ ~~not established~~ ] by  
| appropriation for a school year _._  
|  _(c) The_[ ~~, the~~ ] commissioner _may adopt rules as necessary to_  
| _implement this section._ [ ~~shall determine the state compression~~  
|  ~~percentage for each school year based on the percentage by which a~~  
|  ~~district is able to reduce the district's maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations tax rate for that year, as compared to the district's~~  
|  ~~adopted maintenance and operations tax rate for the 2005 tax year,~~  
|  ~~as a result of state funds appropriated for that year from the~~  
|  ~~property tax relief fund established under Section 403.109,~~  
|  ~~Government Code, or from another funding source available for~~  
|  ~~school district property tax relief.~~

|  Sec. _48.256_ [ ~~42.252~~ ]. LOCAL SHARE OF PROGRAM COST (TIER  
| ONE). (a) Each school district's share of the Foundation School  
| Program is determined by the following formula:  
| LFA = TR X DPV  
| where:  
|  "LFA" is the school district's local share;  
|  "TR" is _the school district's adopted tier one maintenance_  
| _and operations_ [ ~~a~~ ] tax rate _, as described by Section 45.0032(c)_  
| [ ~~which~~ ] for each hundred dollars of valuation [ ~~is an effective
tax~~  
|  ~~rate of the amount equal to the product of the state compression~~  
|  ~~percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the~~  
|  ~~lesser of:~~  
|  [ ~~(1) $1.50; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted~~  
|  ~~by the district for the 2005 tax year~~ ]; and  
|  "DPV" is the taxable value of property in the school district  
| for the preceding tax year determined under Subchapter M, Chapter  
| 403, Government Code.  
|  [ ~~(a-1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~Notwithstanding Subsection (a), for a school~~  
|  ~~district that adopted a maintenance and operations tax rate for the~~  
|  ~~2005 tax year below the maximum rate permitted by law for that year,~~  
|  ~~the district's tax rate ("TR") includes the tax effort included in~~  
|  ~~calculating the district's compressed tax rate under Section~~  
|  ~~42.101(a-1).~~ ]  
|  (b) The commissioner shall adjust the values reported _by_ [ ~~in~~  
|  ~~the official report of~~ ] the comptroller [ ~~as required by Section~~  
|  ~~5.09(a), Tax Code,~~ ] to reflect reductions in taxable value of  
| property resulting from natural or economic disaster [ ~~after January~~  
|  ~~1~~ ] in the year in which the valuations are determined. The decision  
| of the commissioner is final. An adjustment does not affect the  
| local fund assignment of any other school district.  
|  (c) Appeals of district values shall be held pursuant to  
| Section 403.303, Government Code.  
|  (d) A school district must raise its total local share of  
| the Foundation School Program to be eligible to receive foundation  
| school fund payments.  
|  SECTION 1.029. Subchapter F, Chapter 48, Education Code, as  
| added by this Act, is amended by adding Section 48.257 to read as  
| follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___48.257._ _____LOCAL REVENUE LEVEL IN EXCESS OF ENTITLEMENT._  
| _(a) Subject to Subsection (b), if a school district's tier one_  
| _revenue level, which is the sum of the district's tier one local_  
| _share under Section 48.256 and distribution from the state_  
| _available school fund, exceeds the district's entitlement under_  
| _Section 48.266(a)(1), the district must reduce the district's tier_  
| _one revenue level in accordance with Chapter 49 to a level not to_  
| _exceed the district's entitlement under Section 48.266(a)(1)._  
|  _(b)_ _____This subsection applies only to a school district to_  
| _which Subsection (a) applies. If the sum of a district's_  
| _maintenance and operations tax collections for the current tax year_  
| _minus the district's tier one revenue level under Subsection (a) is_  
| _less than the amount of the district's entitlement under Section_  
| _48.266(a)(1), the agency shall adjust the amount of the district's_  
| _tier one revenue level under Subsection (a) to ensure that the_  
| _district retains the amount of local funds necessary for the_  
| _district's entitlement under Section 48.266(a)(1)._  
|  _(c)_ _____For purposes of Subsection (a), state aid to which a_  
| _district is entitled under this chapter that is not described by_  
| _Section 48.266(a)(1) or (2) may offset the amount by which a_  
| _district must reduce the district's tier one revenue level under_  
| _Subsection (a). Any amount of state aid used as an offset under this_  
| _subsection shall reduce the amount of state aid to which the_  
| _district is entitled._  
|  _(d)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (e), a school district_  
| _is entitled to retain the total amount of the district's tier two_  
| _local share described by Section 48.266(a)(5)(A)._  
|  _(e)_ _____In any school year for which the amount of state funds_  
| _appropriated specifically excludes the amount necessary to provide_  
| _the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per_  
| _weighted student per cent of tax effort under Section_  
| _48.202(a-1)(1), a district may only retain the amount of the_  
| _district's tier two local share described by Section_  
| _48.266(a)(5)(A) equal to the amount of revenue that would be_  
| _generated based on the amount appropriated for the dollar amount_  
| _guaranteed level of state and local funds._  
|  _(f)_ _____The amount of a school district's tier two local share_  
| _described by Section 48.266(a)(5)(B) to which a district is_  
| _entitled may not exceed the amount described by Section_  
| _48.202(a-1)(2)._  
|  SECTION 1.030. Sections 41.002(e), (f), and (g), Education  
| Code, are transferred to Section 48.257, Education Code, as added  
| by this Act, redesignated as Sections 48.257(g), (h), and (i),  
| Education Code, and amended to read as follows:  
|  _(g)_ [ ~~(e)~~ ] Notwithstanding _Subsections_ [ ~~Subsection~~ ] (a) _,_  
| _(d), and (f)_ , and except as provided by Subsection _(i)_ [ ~~(g)~~ ], in  
| accordance with a determination of the commissioner, the _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] that a school district may have  
| after exercising an option under Section _49.002(2)_ [ ~~41.003(2)~~ ] or  
| (3) may not be less than the amount needed to maintain state and  
| local revenue in an amount equal to state and local revenue per  
| weighted student for maintenance and operation of the district for  
| the 1992-1993 school year less the district's current year  
| distribution per weighted student from the available school fund,  
| other than amounts distributed under Chapter 31, if the district  
| imposes an effective tax rate for maintenance and operation of the  
| district equal to the greater of the district's current tax rate or  
| $1.50 on the $100 valuation of taxable property.  
|  _(h)_ [ ~~(f)~~ ] For purposes of Subsection _(g)_ [ ~~(e)~~ ], a school  
| district's effective tax rate is determined by dividing the total  
| amount of taxes collected by the district for the applicable school  
| year less any amounts paid into a tax increment fund under Chapter  
| 311, Tax Code, by the quotient of the district's taxable value of  
| property, as determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government  
| Code, divided by 100.  
|  _(i)_ [ ~~(g)~~ ] The _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] that  
| a district may have under Subsection _(g)_ [ ~~(e)~~ ] is adjusted as  
| follows:  
| _ALRL_ [ ~~AWPS~~ ] = _LRL_ [ ~~WPS~~ ] X ((( _ERL_ [ ~~EWL~~ ]/280,000 - 1)
X DTR/1.17) + 1)  
| where:  
|  _"ALRL"_ [ ~~"AWPS"~~ ] is the district's _local revenue level_  
| [ ~~wealth per student~~ ];  
|  _"LRL"_ [ ~~"WPS"~~ ] is the district's _local revenue level_  
| [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] determined under Subsection _(g)_ [ ~~(e)~~ ];  
|  _"ERL"_ [ ~~"EWL"~~ ] is the _local revenue level under this_  
| _section to which a district is entitled_ [ ~~equalized wealth level~~ ];  
| and  
|  "DTR" is the district's adopted maintenance and  
| operations tax rate for the current school year.  
|  SECTION 1.031. Section 48.257, Education Code, as added by  
| this Act, is amended by adding Subsections (j) and (j-1) to read as  
| follows:  
|  _(j)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,_  
| _the local revenue level that a school district may have under_  
| _Subsections (g)-(i) is reduced by the following amounts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____for the 2020-2021 school year, an amount equal to_  
| _20 percent of the difference between the local revenue level for the_  
| _district calculated under Subsections (g)-(i) and the local revenue_  
| _level permitted under Subsections (a), (d), and (f);_  
|  _(2)_ _____for the 2021-2022 school year, an amount equal to_  
| _40 percent of the difference between the local revenue level for the_  
| _district calculated under Subsections (g)-(i) and the local revenue_  
| _level permitted under Subsections (a), (d), and (f);_  
|  _(3)_ _____for the 2022-2023 school year, an amount equal to_

|  _(4)_ _____for the 2023-2024 school year, an amount equal to_  
| _80 percent of the difference between the local revenue level for the_  
| _district calculated under Subsections (g)-(i) and the local revenue_  
| _level permitted under Subsections (a), (d), and (f)._

| TAXABLE VALUE OF PROPERTY. (a) For purposes of Chapters [ ~~41 and~~ ]  
| 46 _and 49_ and this chapter, and to the extent money specifically  
| authorized to be used under this section is available, the  
| commissioner shall adjust the taxable value of property in a school

| calculating taxable values in excess of four percent of the tax base  
| used in the preceding year.  
|  (b) To the extent that a sufficient amount of money is not  
| available to fund all adjustments under this section, the

| Section 403.302(d)(2), Government Code, unless:  
|  (1) funds are specifically appropriated for purposes  
| of this section; or  
|  (2) the commissioner determines that the total amount

| accordingly; and  
|  (2) give priority to school districts that, due to

| shall base the determinations under Subsection (a) on the estimates  
| provided to the legislature under Section _48.269_ [ ~~42.254~~ ], or, if  
| the General Appropriations Act provides estimates for that purpose,  
| on the estimates provided under that Act, for each school district  
| for each school year. The commissioner shall reduce the  
| entitlement of each district that has a final taxable value of  
| property for the second year of a state fiscal biennium that is  
| higher than the estimate under Section _48.269_ [ ~~42.254~~ ] or the  
| General Appropriations Act, as applicable. A reduction under this  
| subsection may not reduce the district's entitlement below the  
| amount to which it is entitled at its actual taxable value of  
| property.  
|  (c) Each school district is entitled to an amount equal to  
| the difference for that district between the sum of Subsections  
| (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the sum of Subsections (a)(3), (a)(4), and  
| (a)(5).  
|  (d) The commissioner shall approve warrants to each school  
| district equaling the amount of its entitlement except as provided  
| by this section. Warrants for all money expended according to this  
| chapter shall be approved and transmitted to treasurers or  
| depositories of school districts in the same manner that warrants  
| for state payments are transmitted. The total amount of the  
| warrants issued under this section may not exceed the total amount  
| appropriated for Foundation School Program purposes for that fiscal  
| year.  
|  _(e)_ [ ~~(g)~~ ] If a school district demonstrates to the  
| satisfaction of the commissioner that the estimate of the  
| district's tax rate, student enrollment, or taxable value of  
| property used in determining the amount of state funds to which the  
| district is entitled are so inaccurate as to result in undue  
| financial hardship to the district, the commissioner may adjust  
| funding to that district in that school year to the extent that  
| funds are available for that year.  
|  _(f)_ [ ~~(h)~~ ] If the amount appropriated for the Foundation  
| School Program for the second year of a state fiscal biennium is  
| less than the amount to which school districts and open-enrollment  
| charter schools are entitled for that year, the commissioner shall  
| certify the amount of the difference to the Legislative Budget  
| Board not later than January 1 of the second year of the state  
| fiscal biennium. The Legislative Budget Board shall propose to the  
| legislature that the certified amount be transferred to the  
| foundation school fund from the economic stabilization fund and  
| appropriated for the purpose of increases in allocations under this  
| subsection. If the legislature fails during the regular session to  
| enact the proposed transfer and appropriation and there are not  
| funds available under Subsection _(h)_ [ ~~(j)~~ ], the commissioner shall  
| adjust the total amounts due to each school district and  
| open-enrollment charter school under this chapter and the total  
| amounts necessary for each school district to comply with the  
| requirements of Chapter _49_ [ ~~41~~ ] by an amount determined by applying  
| to each district and school the same percentage adjustment to the  
| total amount of state and local revenue due to the district or  
| school under this chapter and Chapter _49_ [ ~~41~~ ] so that the total  
| amount of the adjustment to all districts and schools results in an  
| amount equal to the total adjustment necessary. The following  
| fiscal year:  
|  (1) a district's or school's entitlement under this  
| section is increased by an amount equal to the adjustment made  
| under this subsection; and  
|  (2) the amount necessary for a district to comply with  
| the requirements of Chapter _49_ [ ~~41~~ ] is reduced by an amount  
| necessary to ensure a district's full recovery of the adjustment  
| made under this subsection.  
|  _(g)_ [ ~~(i)~~ ] Not later than March 1 each year, the commissioner  
| shall determine the actual amount of state funds to which each  
| school district is entitled under the allocation formulas in this  
| chapter for the current school year and shall compare that amount  
| with the amount of the warrants issued to each district for that  
| year. If the amount of the warrants differs from the amount to  
| which a district is entitled because of variations in the  
| district's tax rate, student enrollment, or taxable value of  
| property, the commissioner shall adjust the district's entitlement  
| for the next fiscal year accordingly.  
|  _(h)_ [ ~~(j)~~ ] The legislature may appropriate funds necessary  
| for increases under Subsection _(g)_ [ ~~(i)~~ ] from funds that the  
| comptroller, at any time during the fiscal year, finds are  
| available.  
|  _(i)_ [ ~~(k)~~ ] The commissioner shall compute for each school  
| district the total amount by which the district's allocation of  
| state funds is increased or reduced under Subsection _(g)_ [ ~~(i)~~ ] and  
| shall certify that amount to the district.  
|  Sec. _48.267_ [ ~~42.2531~~ ]. ADJUSTMENT BY COMMISSIONER. (a)  
| The commissioner may make adjustments to amounts due to a school  
| district under this chapter or Chapter 46, or to amounts necessary  
| for a district to comply with the requirements of Chapter _49_ [ ~~41~~ ],  
| as provided by this section.  
|  (b) A school district that has a major taxpayer, as  
| determined by the commissioner, that because of a protest of the  
| valuation of the taxpayer's property fails to pay all or a portion  
| of the ad valorem taxes due to the district may apply to the  
| commissioner to have the district's taxable value of property or ad  
| valorem tax collections adjusted for purposes of this chapter or  
| Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46 _or 49_. The commissioner may make the adjustment  
| only to the extent the commissioner determines that making the  
| adjustment will not:  
|  (1) in the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made,  
| cause the amount to which school districts are entitled under this  
| chapter to exceed the amount appropriated for purposes of the  
| Foundation School Program for that year; and  
|  (2) if the adjustment is made in the first year of a  
| state fiscal biennium, cause the amount to which school districts  
| are entitled under this chapter for the second year of the biennium  
| to exceed the amount appropriated for purposes of the Foundation  
| School Program for that year.  
|  (c) The commissioner shall recover the benefit of any  
| adjustment made under this section by making offsetting adjustments  
| in the school district's taxable value of property or ad valorem tax  
| collections for purposes of this chapter or Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46 _or 49_  
| on a final determination of the taxable value of property that was  
| the basis of the original adjustment, or in the second school year  
| following the year in which the adjustment is made, whichever is  
| earlier.  
|  (d) This section does not require the commissioner to make  
| any requested adjustment. A determination by the commissioner  
| under this section is final and may not be appealed.  
|  Sec. _48.268_ [ ~~42.2532~~ ]. ADJUSTMENT FOR RESOLUTION OF  
| DISPUTE OR ERROR RESULTING IN TAXATION OF SAME PROPERTY BY MULTIPLE  
| SCHOOL DISTRICTS. The commissioner shall adjust the amounts due to  
| a school district under this chapter and Chapter 46 as necessary to  
| account for the resolution of a dispute or error involving the  
| district and another district by an agreement between the districts  
| entered into under Section 31.112(c), Tax Code, or by a final order  
| of the supreme court entered under Section 72.010, Local Government  
| Code.  
|  Sec. _48.269_ [ ~~42.254~~ ]. ESTIMATES REQUIRED. (a) Not later  
| than October 1 of each even-numbered year:  
|  (1) the agency shall submit to the legislature an  
| estimate of the tax rate and student enrollment of each school  
| district for the following biennium; and  
|  (2) the comptroller shall submit to the legislature an  
| estimate of the total taxable value of all property in the state as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, for  
| the following biennium.  
|  (b) The agency and the comptroller shall update the  
| information provided to the legislature under Subsection (a) not  
| later than March 1 of each odd-numbered year.  
|  Sec. _48.270_ [ ~~42.255~~ ]. FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS; REPORT.  
| When, in the opinion of the agency's director of school audits,  
| audits or reviews of accounting, enrollment, or other records of a  
| school district reveal deliberate falsification of the records, or  
| violation of the provisions of this chapter, through which the  
| district's share of state funds allocated under the authority of  
| this chapter would be, or has been, illegally increased, the  
| director shall promptly and fully report the fact to the State Board  
| of Education, the state auditor, and the appropriate county  
| attorney, district attorney, or criminal district attorney.  
|  Sec. _48.271_ [ ~~42.257~~ ]. EFFECT OF APPRAISAL APPEAL. (a) If  
| the final determination of an appeal under Chapter 42, Tax Code,  
| results in a reduction in the taxable value of property that exceeds  
| five percent of the total taxable value of property in the school  
| district for the same tax year determined under Subchapter M,  
| Chapter 403, Government Code, the commissioner shall request the  
| comptroller to adjust its taxable property value findings for that  
| year consistent with the final determination of the appraisal  
| appeal.  
|  (b) If the district would have received a greater amount  
| from the foundation school fund for the applicable school year  
| using the adjusted value, the commissioner shall add the difference  
| to subsequent distributions to the district from the foundation  
| school fund. An adjustment does not affect the local fund  
| assignment of any other district.  
|  Sec. _48.272_ [ ~~42.258~~ ]. RECOVERY OF OVERALLOCATED FUNDS.  
| (a) If a school district has received an overallocation of state  
| funds, the agency shall, by withholding from subsequent allocations  
| of state funds for the current or subsequent school year or by  
| requesting and obtaining a refund, recover from the district an  
| amount equal to the overallocation.  
|  _(b)_ [ ~~(a-1)~~ ] Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the agency may  
| recover an overallocation of state funds over a period not to exceed  
| the subsequent five school years if the commissioner determines  
| that the overallocation was the result of exceptional circumstances  
| reasonably caused by statutory changes to Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46 _or 49_  
| or this chapter and related reporting requirements.  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] If a district fails to comply with a request for a  
| refund under Subsection (a), the agency shall certify to the  
| comptroller that the amount constitutes a debt for purposes of  
| Section 403.055, Government Code. The agency shall provide to the  
| comptroller the amount of the overallocation and any other  
| information required by the comptroller. The comptroller may  
| certify the amount of the debt to the attorney general for  
| collection.  
|  _(d)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] Any amounts recovered under this section shall be  
| deposited in the foundation school fund.

| to consolidate a district notified under Subdivision (1), if  
| necessary, under Subchapter H.  
|  (b) If, before the dates provided by this subsection, a

| reduce the district's _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] to a  
| level equal to or less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level  
| _established under Section 48.257_ , the commissioner shall order the  
| detachment of property from that district as provided by Subchapter

| _level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] to a level equal to or less than the  
| [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_ , the  
| commissioner may not detach property under Subchapter G but shall

| [ ~~achieved the equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section_  
| _48.257_.  
|  (d) A detachment and annexation or consolidation under this  
| chapter:  
|  (1) is effective for Foundation School Program funding  
| purposes for the school year that begins in the calendar year in

| BOUNDARY CHANGES. A school district that is involved in an action  
| under this chapter that results in boundary changes to the district  
| or in the consolidation of tax bases is subject to consolidation,  
| detachment, or annexation under Chapter 13 only if the commissioner  
| certifies that the change under Chapter 13 will not result in a  
| district with a _local revenue_ [ ~~wealth per student that exceeds the~~  
|  ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _in excess of entitlement_.  
|  Sec. _49.008_ [ ~~41.008~~ ]. HOMESTEAD EXEMPTIONS. (a) The  
| governing board of a school district that results from  
| consolidation under this chapter, including a consolidated taxing  
| district under Subchapter F, for the tax year in which the

| exemption provided by Section 11.13, Tax Code, and may set the  
| amount of the exemption, if adopted, at any time before the school  
| district adopts a tax rate for that tax year. This section applies  
| only to an exemption that the governing board of a school district  
| is authorized to adopt or change in amount under Section 11.13, Tax  
| Code.

| this chapter is not affected and applies to the taxation of the  
| property covered by the agreement as if executed by the district  
| within which the property is included.  
|  (b) The commissioner shall determine the _local revenue_  
| [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] of a school district under this chapter as if

| affected by the consolidation of territory or tax bases or by  
| annexation under this chapter. In each tax year a school district  
| paying a tax increment from taxes on property over which the  
| district has assumed taxing power is entitled to retain the same  
| percentage of the tax increment from that property that the  
| district in which the property was located before the consolidation  
| or annexation could have retained for the respective tax year.  
|  _(b)_ _____This section does not apply to the payment of tax_  
| _increments for an obligation refinanced or renewed after September_  
| _1, 2019._  
|  Sec. _49.011_ [ ~~41.011~~ ]. CONTINGENCY. (a) If any of the  
| options described by Section _49.002_ [ ~~41.003~~ ] as applied to a school  
| district are held invalid by a final decision of a court of  
| competent jurisdiction, a school district is entitled to exercise  
| any of the remaining valid options in accordance with a schedule  
| approved by the commissioner.  
|  (b) If a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction  
| should hold each of the options provided by Section _49.002_ [ ~~41.003~~ ]  
| invalid, the commissioner shall act under Subchapter G or H to  
| _reduce the local revenue_ [ ~~achieve the equalized wealth~~ ] level _in_  
| _excess of entitlement_ only after notice and hearing is afforded to  
| each school district affected by the order. The commissioner shall  
| adopt a plan that least disrupts the affected school districts. If  
| because the exigency to adopt a plan prevents the commissioner from  
| giving a reasonable time for notice and hearing, the commissioner  
| shall timely give notice to and hold a hearing for the affected  
| school districts, but in no event less than 30 days from time of  
| notice to the date of hearing.  
|  (c) If a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction  
| should hold an option provided by Section _49.002_ [ ~~41.003~~ ] invalid  
| and order a refund to a district of any amounts paid by a district  
| choosing that option, the amount shall be refunded but held in  
| reserve and not expended by the district until released by order of  
| the commissioner. The commissioner shall order the release  
| immediately on the commissioner's determination that, through one  
| of the means provided by law, the district has _reduced the_  
| _district's local revenue level in excess of entitlement to the_  
| [ ~~achieved the equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section_  
| _48.257_. The amount released shall be deducted from any state aid  
| payable to the district according to a schedule adopted by the  
| commissioner.  
|  Sec. _49.012_ [ ~~41.012~~ ]. DATE OF ELECTIONS. An election under  
| this chapter for voter approval of an agreement entered by the board  
| of trustees shall be held on a Tuesday or Saturday not more than 45  
| days after the date of the agreement. Section 41.001, Election  
| Code, does not apply to the election.

|  (b) Any order of the commissioner issued under this chapter  
| shall be given immediate effect and may not be stayed or enjoined  
| pending any appeal.

| consolidated district with a _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per~~  
|  ~~student~~ ] equal to or less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level  
| _established under Section 48.257_. The agreement is not effective  
| unless the commissioner certifies that the consolidated district,  
| as a result of actions taken under this chapter, will have a _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] equal to or less than the  
| [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_.  
|  Sec. _49.052_ [ ~~41.032~~ ]. GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent  
| modified by the terms of the agreement, the consolidated district  
| is governed by the applicable provisions of Subchapter D, Chapter

| contiguous. The agreement may not be inconsistent with the  
| requirements of this subchapter.  
|  Sec. _49.053_ [ ~~41.033~~ ]. GOVERNANCE PLAN. (a) The agreement  
| among the consolidating districts may include a governance plan

| the power to levy taxes, including a provision authorized by  
| Section 13.158(b).  
|  (b) The governance plan may provide for a transitional board  
| of trustees during the first year after consolidation, but  
| beginning with the next year the board of trustees must be elected  
| from within the boundaries of the consolidated district. If the  
| consolidating districts elect trustees from single-member  
| districts, the consolidated district must adopt a plan to elect its  
| board of trustees from single-member districts.

| second school years after creation of a consolidated district under  
| this subchapter, the commissioner shall adjust allotments to the  
| consolidated district to the extent necessary to preserve the  
| effects of an adjustment under Section _48.052_ [ ~~42.102, 42.103, or~~  
|  ~~42.105~~ ] to which either of the consolidating districts would have  
| been entitled but for the consolidation.

| district under this subchapter within a period of one year may elect  
| to receive incentive aid under this section or to receive incentive  
| aid for not more than five years under Subchapter G, Chapter 13.  
| Incentive aid under this subsection may not provide the  
| consolidated district with more revenue in state and local funds  
| than the district would receive at the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level  
| _established under Section 48.257_.  
|  SECTION 1.040. Subchapter C, Chapter 41, Education Code, is  
| transferred to Chapter 49, Education Code, redesignated as

|  Sec. _49.101_ [ ~~41.061~~ ]. AGREEMENT. (a) By agreement of the  
| governing boards of two school districts, territory may be detached  
| from one of the districts and annexed to the other district if,  
| after the action:

| the district from which territory is detached is equal to or less  
| than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_ ;  
| and  
|  (2) the _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] of  
| the district to which territory is annexed is not greater than the  
| greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter _E_ [ ~~F~~ ],  
| Chapter _48_ [ ~~42~~ ].  
|  (b) The agreement is not effective unless the commissioner  
| certifies that, after all actions taken under this chapter, the  
| _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] of each district involved  
| will be equal to or less than the applicable level permitted by  
| Subsection (a).  
|  Sec. _49.102_ [ ~~41.062~~ ]. GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent  
| of any conflict with this chapter and except for any requirement  
| that detached property must be annexed to a school district that is  
| contiguous to the detached territory, the annexation and detachment  
| is governed by Chapter 13.  
|  Sec. _49.103_ [ ~~41.063~~ ]. ALLOCATION OF APPRAISED VALUE OF  
| DIVIDED UNIT. If portions of a parcel or other item of property are  
| located in different school districts as a result of a detachment

| the districts.  
|  Sec. _49.104_ [ ~~41.064~~ ]. ALLOCATION OF INDEBTEDNESS. The  
| annexation agreement may allocate to the receiving district any

| under this chapter, to reduce the district's _local revenue level_  
| [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] to a level that is equal to or less than the  
| [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_.  
|  Sec. _49.152_ [ ~~41.092~~ ]. CREDIT. _The amount of_ [ ~~(a) For each~~ ]

| any school year is reduced by an amount equal to the product of the  
| district's total costs under Section 6.06, Tax Code, for the  
| appraisal district or districts in which it participates multiplied

|  ~~per student~~ ] by serving nonresident students who transfer to the  
| district and are educated by the district but who are not charged  
| tuition. A district that exercises the option under this  
| subsection is not required to execute an agreement with the school  
| district in which a transferring student resides and must certify  
| to the commissioner that the district has not charged or received  
| tuition for the transferring students.

|  SECTION 1.049. Subchapter G, Chapter 41, Education Code, is  
| transferred to Chapter 49, Education Code, as added by this Act,  
| redesignated as Subchapter G, Chapter 49, Education Code, and  
| amended to read as follows:  
| SUBCHAPTER G. DETACHMENT AND ANNEXATION BY COMMISSIONER  
|  Sec. _49.301_ [ ~~41.201~~ ]. DEFINITION. In this subchapter,  
| "mineral property" means a real property mineral interest that has  
| been severed from the surface estate by a mineral lease creating a  
| determinable fee or by a conveyance that creates an interest  
| taxable separately from the surface estate. A mineral property  
| includes each royalty interest, working interest, or other  
| undivided interest in the mineral property.  
|  Sec. _49.302_ [ ~~41.202~~ ]. DETERMINATION OF TAXABLE VALUE. (a)  
| For purposes of this subchapter, the taxable value of an individual  
| parcel or other item of property and the total taxable value of  
| property in a school district resulting from the detachment of  
| property from or annexation of property to that district is  
| determined by applying the appraisal ratio for the appropriate  
| category of property determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403,  
| Government Code, for the preceding tax year to the taxable value of  
| the detached or annexed property determined under Title 1, Tax  
| Code, for the preceding tax year.  
|  (b) For purposes of this subchapter, the taxable value of  
| all or a portion of a parcel or item of real property includes the  
| taxable value of personal property having taxable situs at the same  
| location as the real property.  
|  Sec. _49.303_ [ ~~41.203~~ ]. PROPERTY SUBJECT TO DETACHMENT AND  
| ANNEXATION. (a) Only the following property may be detached and  
| annexed under this subchapter:  
|  (1) a mineral property;  
|  (2) real property used in the operation of a public  
| utility, including a pipeline, pipeline gathering system, or  
| railroad or other rail system; and  
|  (3) real property used primarily for industrial or  
| other commercial purposes, other than property used primarily for  
| agriculture or for residential purposes.  
|  (b) If a final judgment of a court determines that a mineral  
| interest may not be annexed and detached as provided by this  
| subchapter without an attendant annexation and detachment of the  
| surface estate or any other interest in the same land, the  
| detachment and annexation of a mineral interest under this  
| subchapter includes the surface estate and each other interest in  
| the land covered by the mineral interest.  
|  Sec. _49.304_ [ ~~41.204~~ ]. TAXATION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.  
| Personal property having a taxable situs at the same location as  
| real property detached and annexed under this subchapter is taxable  
| by the school district to which the real property is annexed.  
|  Sec. _49.305_ [ ~~41.205~~ ]. DETACHMENT OF PROPERTY. (a) The  
| commissioner shall detach property under this section from each  
| school district from which the commissioner is required under  
| Section _49.004_ [ ~~41.004~~ ] to detach property under this subchapter.  
|  (b) The commissioner shall detach from each school district  
| covered by Subsection (a) one or more whole parcels or items of  
| property in descending order of the taxable value of each parcel or  
| item, beginning with the parcel or item having the greatest taxable  
| value, until the school district's _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per~~  
|  ~~student~~ ] is equal to or less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level  
| _established under Section 48.257_ , except as otherwise provided by  
| Subsection (c).  
|  (c) If the detachment of whole parcels or items of property  
| [ ~~,~~ ] as provided by Subsection (a) would result in a district's _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] that is less than the [
~~equalized~~  
|  ~~wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_ by more than _the_  
| _product of_ $10,000 _multiplied by weighted average daily attendance_ ,  
| the commissioner may not detach the last parcel or item of property  
| and shall detach the next one or more parcels or items of property  
| in descending order of taxable value that would result in the school  
| district having a _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] that is  
| equal to or less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established_  
| _under Section 48.257_ by not more than _the product of_ $10,000  
| _multiplied by weighted average daily attendance_.  
|  (d) Notwithstanding Subsections (a), (b), and (c), the  
| commissioner may detach only a portion of a parcel or item of  
| property if:  
|  (1) it is not possible _under this subchapter_ to reduce  
| the district's _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] to a level  
| that is equal to or less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level  
| _established_ under _Section 48.257_ [ ~~this subchapter~~ ] unless some or  
| all of the parcel or item of property is detached and the detachment  
| of the whole parcel or item would result in the district from which  
| it is detached having a _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ]  
| that is less than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under_  
| _Section 48.257_ by more than _the product of_ $10,000 _multiplied by_  
| _weighted average daily attendance_ ; or  
|  (2) the commissioner determines that a partial  
| detachment of that parcel or item of property is preferable to the  
| detachment of one or more other parcels or items having a lower  
| taxable value in order to minimize the number of parcels or items of  
| property to be detached consistent with the purposes of this  
| chapter.  
|  Sec. _49.306_ [ ~~41.206~~ ]. ANNEXATION OF PROPERTY. (a) The  
| commissioner shall annex property detached under Section _49.305_  
| [ ~~41.205~~ ] to school districts eligible for annexation in accordance  
| with this section. A school district is eligible for annexation of  
| property to it under this subchapter only if, before any  
| detachments or annexations are made in a year, the district's  
| _taxable value of property does not exceed the value necessary to_  
| _generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal_  
| _to the district's entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth~~  
|  ~~per student is less than the greatest level for which funds are~~  
|  ~~provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ].  
|  (b) Property may be annexed to a school district without  
| regard to whether the property is contiguous to other property in  
| that district.  
|  (c) The commissioner shall annex property detached from  
| school districts beginning with the property detached from the  
| school district with the greatest _local revenue level in excess of_  
| _entitlement_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] before detachment, and continuing  
| with the property detached from each other school district in  
| descending order of the district's _local revenue level in excess of_  
| _entitlement_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] before detachment.  
|  (d) The commissioner shall annex the parcels or items of  
| property detached from a school district to other school districts  
| that are eligible for annexation of property in descending order of  
| the taxable value of each parcel or item according to the following  
| priorities:  
|  (1) first, to the eligible school districts assigned  
| to the same county as the school district from which the property is  
| detached whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year  
| does not exceed by more than $0.15 the total tax rate adopted for  
| that year by the school district from which the property is  
| detached;  
|  (2) second, to the eligible school districts served by  
| the same regional education service center as the district from  
| which the property is detached whose total adopted tax rate for the  
| preceding tax year does not exceed by more than $0.10 the total tax  
| rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the  
| property is detached; and  
|  (3) third, to other eligible school districts whose  
| total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by  
| more than $0.05 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the  
| school district from which the property is detached.  
|  (e) If the districts identified by Subsection (d) for a  
| school district are insufficient to annex all the property detached  
| from the school district, the commissioner shall increase, for  
| purposes of this section, all the maximum difference in tax rates  
| allowed under Subsection (d) in increments of $0.01 until the  
| districts are identified that are sufficient to annex all the  
| property detached from the district.  
|  (f) If only one school district is eligible to annex  
| property detached from a school district within a priority group  
| established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall  
| annex property to that district until it reaches _the taxable value_  
| _of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax_  
| _revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under_  
| _Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~a wealth per student equal as nearly as~~  
|  ~~possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under~~  
|  ~~Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ], by annexing whole parcels or items of  
| property. Any remaining detached property shall be annexed to  
| eligible school districts in the next priority group as provided by  
| this section.  
|  (g) If more than one school district is eligible to annex  
| property detached from a school district within a priority group  
| established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall  
| first annex property to the district within the priority group to  
| which could be annexed the most taxable value of property without  
| increasing _the district's taxable value of property to an amount_  
| _that exceeds the amount necessary to generate maintenance and_  
| _operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's_  
| _entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~its wealth per student~~  
|  ~~above the greatest level for which funds are provided under~~  
|  ~~Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ], until that district reaches a _taxable_  
| _value of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations_  
| _tax revenue in the amount equal to the district's entitlement under_  
| _Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth per student equal as nearly as~~  
|  ~~possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under~~  
|  ~~Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ], by annexing whole parcels or items of  
| property. Then any additional detached property shall be annexed  
| in the same manner to other eligible school districts in the same  
| priority group in descending order of capacity to receive taxable  
| value of annexed property without increasing the district's _taxable_  
| _value of property to an amount that exceeds the amount necessary to_  
| _generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal_  
| _to the district's entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth~~  
|  ~~per student above the greatest level for which funds are provided~~  
|  ~~under Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ]. If every school district in a  
| priority group reaches a _taxable value of property necessary to_  
| _generate maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal_  
| _to the district's entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth~~  
|  ~~per student equal to the greatest level for which funds are provided~~  
|  ~~under Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ], as nearly as possible, the  
| remaining detached property shall be annexed to school districts in  
| the next priority group in the manner provided by this section.  
|  (h) For purposes of this section, a portion of a parcel or  
| item of property detached in that subdivided form from a school  
| district is treated as a whole parcel or item of property.  
|  (i) The commissioner may order the annexation of a portion  
| of a parcel or item of property, including a portion of property  
| treated as a whole parcel or item under Subsection (h), if:  
|  (1) the annexation of the whole parcel or item would  
| result in the district eligible to receive it in the appropriate  
| priority order provided by this section having a _local revenue_  
| _level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] greater than _the amount by which the_  
| _product of_ $10,000 _multiplied by weighted average daily attendance_  
| _exceeds the taxable value of property necessary to generate_  
| _maintenance and operations tax revenue in the amount equal to the_  
| _district's entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~more than the~~  
|  ~~greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F,~~  
|  ~~Chapter 42~~ ]; or  
|  (2) the commissioner determines that annexation of  
| portions of the parcel or item would reduce disparities in district  
| _taxable values of property necessary to generate maintenance and_  
| _operations tax revenue in the amount equal to a district's_  
| _entitlement under Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] more  
| efficiently than would be possible if the parcel or item were  
| annexed as a whole.  
|  (j) The commissioner may modify the priorities established  
| by this section as the commissioner considers reasonable to  
| minimize or reduce the number of school districts to which the  
| property detached from a school district is annexed, to minimize or  
| reduce the geographic dispersal of property in a school district,  
| to minimize or reduce disparities in school district _taxable values_  
| _of property necessary to generate maintenance and operations tax_  
| _revenue in the amount equal to a district's entitlement under_  
| _Section 48.202(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] that would otherwise  
| result, or to minimize or reduce any administrative burden or  
| expense.  
|  (k) For purposes of this section, a school district is  
| assigned to a county if the school district is assigned to that  
| county in the 1992-1993 Texas School Directory published by the  
| Central Education Agency.  
|  Sec. _49.307_ [ ~~41.207~~ ]. LIMITATIONS ON DETACHMENT AND  
| ANNEXATION. The commissioner may detach and annex property under  
| this subchapter only if:  
|  (1) the property is not exempt from ad valorem  
| taxation under Section 11.20 or 11.21, Tax Code; and  
|  (2) the property does not contain a building or  
| structure owned by the United States, this state, or a political  
| subdivision of this state that is exempt from ad valorem taxation  
| under law.  
|  Sec. _49.308_ [ ~~41.208~~ ]. ORDERS AND NOTICE. (a) The

| Subsection (a), the commissioner shall notify each affected school  
| district and the appraisal district in which the affected property  
| is located of the determination.  
|  Sec. _49.309_ [ ~~41.209~~ ]. TREATMENT OF SUBDIVIDED PROPERTY.  
| (a) If the commissioner orders the detachment or annexation of a  
| portion of a parcel or item of property under this subchapter, the  
| order shall specify the portion of the taxable value of the property  
| to be detached or annexed and may, but need not, describe the  
| specific area of the parcel or item to be detached or annexed.  
|  (b) If an order for the detachment or annexation of a  
| portion of a parcel or item of property does not describe the  
| specific area of the parcel or item to be detached or annexed, the  
| commissioner, as soon as practicable after issuing the order, shall  
| determine the specific area to be detached or annexed and shall  
| certify that determination to the appraisal district for the county  
| in which the property is located.  
|  (c) If portions of a parcel or item of property are located  
| in two or more school districts as the result of a detachment or  
| annexation, the parcel or item shall be appraised for taxation as a  
| unit, and the commissioner shall determine the portion of the  
| taxable value of the property that is located in each of those  
| school districts based on the square footage of the property, or any  
| other reasonable method adopted by the commissioner.  
|  Sec. _49.310_ [ ~~41.210~~ ]. DUTIES OF CHIEF APPRAISER. (a) The  
| chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall cooperate with the  
| commissioner in administering this subchapter. The commissioner  
| may require the chief appraiser to submit any reports or provide any  
| information available to the chief appraiser in the form and at the  
| times required by the commissioner.  
|  (b) As soon as practicable after the detachment and  
| annexation of property, the chief appraiser of the appraisal  
| district in which the property is located shall send a written  
| notice of the detachment and annexation to the owner of any property  
| taxable in a different school district as a result of the detachment  
| and annexation.  The notice must include the name of the school  
| district by which the property is taxable after the detachment and  
| annexation.  
|  (c) The commissioner may reimburse an appraisal district  
| for any costs incurred in administering this subchapter and may  
| condition the reimbursement or the amount of the reimbursement on  
| the timely submission of reports or information required by the  
| commissioner or the satisfactory performance of any other action  
| required or requested by the commissioner.  
|  Sec. _49.311_ [ ~~41.211~~ ]. STUDENT ATTENDANCE. A student who  
| is a resident of real property detached from a school district may  
| choose to attend school in that district or in the district to which  
| the property is annexed. For purposes of determining average daily  
| attendance under Section _48.005_ [ ~~42.005~~ ], the student shall be  
| counted in the district to which the property is annexed. If the  
| student chooses to attend school in the district from which the  
| property is detached, the state shall withhold any foundation  
| school funds from the district to which the property is annexed and  
| shall allocate to the district in which the student is attending  
| school those funds and the amount of funds equal to the difference  
| between the state funds the district is receiving for the student  
| and the district's cost in educating the student.  
|  Sec. _49.312_ [ ~~41.212~~ ]. BOND TAXES. Property detached from  
| a school district is released from the obligation for any tax to pay  
| principal and interest on bonds authorized by the district before  
| detachment. The property is subject to any tax to pay principal or  
| interest on bonds authorized by the district to which the property  
| is annexed whether authorized before or after annexation.

| SUBCHAPTER H. CONSOLIDATION BY COMMISSIONER  
|  Sec. _49.351_ [ ~~41.251~~ ]. COMMISSIONER ORDER. If the  
| commissioner is required under Section _49.004_ [ ~~41.004~~ ] to order the  
| consolidation of districts, the consolidation is governed by this  
| subchapter. The commissioner's order shall be effective on a date  
| determined by the commissioner, but not later than the earliest  
| practicable date after November 8.  
|  Sec. _49.352_ [ ~~41.252~~ ]. SELECTION CRITERIA. (a) In  
| selecting the districts to be consolidated with a district that has  
| _taxable values of property in an amount that exceeds the local_  
| _revenue level established under Section 48.257_ [ ~~a property wealth~~  
|  ~~greater than the equalized wealth level~~ ], the commissioner shall  
| select one or more districts [ ~~with a wealth per student~~ ] that, when  
| consolidated, will result in a consolidated district with a _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] equal to or less than the  
| [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_. In  
| achieving that result, the commissioner shall give priority to  
| school districts in the following order:  
|  (1) first, to the contiguous district that has the  
| lowest _local revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] and is located in  
| the same county;  
|  (2) second, to the district that has the lowest _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] and is located in the same  
| county;  
|  (3) third, to a contiguous district with a _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~property wealth~~ ] below the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ]
level  
| _established under Section 48.257_ that has requested the  
| commissioner that it be considered in a consolidation plan;  
|  (4) fourth, to include as few districts as possible  
| that _have the lowest local revenue levels below the_ [ ~~fall below the~~  
|  ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_ within the  
| consolidation order that have not requested the commissioner to be  
| included;  
|  (5) fifth, to the district that has the lowest _local_  
| _revenue level_ [ ~~wealth per student~~ ] and is located in the same  
| regional education service center area; and  
|  (6) sixth, to a district that has a tax rate similar to  
| that of the district that has a _local revenue level_ [ ~~property~~  
|  ~~wealth~~ ] greater than the [ ~~equalized wealth~~ ] level _established
under_  
| _Section 48.257_.  
|  (b) The commissioner may not select a district that has been  
| created as a result of consolidation by agreement under Subchapter  
| B to be consolidated under this subchapter with a district that has  
| a _local revenue level_ [ ~~property wealth~~ ] greater than the [
~~equalized~~  
|  ~~wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_.  
|  (c) In applying the selection criteria specified by  
| Subsection (a), if more than two districts are to be consolidated,  
| the commissioner shall select the third and each subsequent  
| district to be consolidated by treating the district that has a  
| _local revenue level_ [ ~~property wealth~~ ] greater than the [
~~equalized~~  
|  ~~wealth~~ ] level _established under Section 48.257_ and the district or  
| districts previously selected for consolidation as one district.  
|  Sec. _49.353_ [ ~~41.253~~ ]. GOVERNANCE. (a) Until the initial  
| trustees elected as provided by Subsection (b) have qualified and  
| taken office, a district consolidated under this subchapter is  
| governed by a transitional board of trustees consisting of the  
| board of trustees of the district having the greatest student  
| membership on the last day of the school year preceding the  
| consolidation plus one member of the board of trustees of each other  
| consolidating district selected by that board.  
|  (b) The transitional board of trustees shall divide the  
| consolidated district into nine single-member trustee districts in  
| accordance with the procedures provided by Section 11.052.  The  
| transitional board shall order an election for the initial board of  
| trustees to be held on the first May uniform election date after the  
| effective date of a consolidation order.  
|  (c) Members of the board of trustees of a consolidated  
| district serve staggered terms of office for four years.  
|  (d) Section 13.156 applies to districts consolidated under  
| this subchapter.  
|  Sec. _49.354_ [ ~~41.254~~ ]. DISSOLUTION OF CONSOLIDATED  
| DISTRICT. (a) If the legislature abolishes ad valorem taxes for  
| public school maintenance and operations and adopts another method  
| of funding public education, the board of trustees of a  
| consolidated district created under this subchapter may dissolve  
| the consolidated district, provided that the dissolution is  
| approved by a majority of those voters residing within the district  
| participating in an election called for the purpose of approving  
| the dissolution of the consolidated school district.  
|  (b) If a consolidated district is dissolved, each of the  
| former districts is restored as a separate district and is  
| classified as an independent district.  
|  (c) Title to real property of the consolidated district is  
| allocated to the restored district in which the property is  
| located. Title to proportionate shares of the fund balances and  
| personal property of the consolidated district, as determined by  
| Subsection (e), are allocated to each restored district.  
|  (d) Each of the restored districts assumes and is liable  
| for:  
|  (1) indebtedness of the consolidated district that  
| relates to real property allocated to the district; and  
|  (2) a proportionate share, as determined by Subsection  
| (e), of indebtedness of the consolidated district that does not  
| relate to real property.  
|  (e) A restored district's proportionate share of fund  
| balances, personal property, or indebtedness is equal to the  
| proportion that the number of students in average daily attendance  
| in the restored district bears to the number of students in average  
| daily attendance in the consolidated district.  
|  Sec. _49.355_ [ ~~41.255~~ ]. FUND BALANCES. Fund balances of a  
| school district consolidated under this subchapter may be used only

| the funds.  
|  Sec. _49.356_ [ ~~41.256~~ ]. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS. A  
| consolidated district created under this subchapter shall honor an  
| employment contract entered into by a consolidating district.

| _ADJUSTMENT_ [ ~~ADJUSTMENTS~~ ] AND _SMALL AND_ TRANSPORTATION _ALLOTMENTS_  
| [ ~~ALLOTMENT~~ ]. The budget of the consolidated district must apply  
| the benefit of the adjustment or allotment to the schools of the  
| consolidating district to which Section _48.052_ [ ~~42.103~~ ], _48.101_  
| [ ~~42.105~~ ], or _48.151_ [ ~~42.155~~ ] would have applied in the event
that  
| the consolidated district still qualifies as a small or sparse  
| district.

| amending Subsections (a), (b), (d), (g), (i), and (n) and adding  
| Subsections (a-1) and (n-1) to read as follows:  
|  (a) If the governing body of a school district adopts a tax  
| rate that exceeds the district's _ratification_ [ ~~rollback~~ ] tax rate,  
| the registered voters of the district at an election held for that  
| purpose must determine whether to approve the adopted tax rate.  
|  _(a-1)_ When increased expenditure of money by a school  
| district is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a  
| tornado, hurricane, flood, or other calamity, but not including a  
| drought, that has impacted a school district and the governor has  
| requested federal disaster assistance for the area in which the  
| school district is located, an election is not required under this  
| section to approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body for  
| the year following the year in which the disaster occurs. _A tax_  
| _rate adopted under this subsection applies only in the year for_  
| _which the rate is adopted. If a district adopts a tax rate under_  
| _this subsection, the amount by which that rate exceeds the_  
| _district's ratification tax rate for that tax year may not be_  
| _considered when calculating the district's ratification tax rate_  
| _for the tax year following the year in which the district adopts the_  
| _rate._  
|  (b) The governing body shall order that the election be held  
| in the school district on _the next uniform election_ [ ~~a~~ ] date  
| _prescribed by_ [ ~~not less than 30 or more than 90 days after the day on~~  
|  ~~which it adopted the tax rate.~~ ] Section 41.001, Election Code, _that_  
| _occurs after the date of the election order and that allows_  
| _sufficient time to comply with the requirements of other law_ [ ~~does~~  
|  ~~not apply to the election unless a date specified by that section~~  
|  ~~falls within the time permitted by this section~~ ].  At the election,  
| the ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or against the  
| proposition:  " _Ratifying_ [ ~~Approving~~ ] the ad valorem tax rate of
_____  
| _(insert adopted tax rate)_ [ ~~$_____ per $100 valuation~~ ] in (name of  
| school district) for the current year, a rate that _will result in an_  
| _increase of _____ (insert percentage increase in maintenance and_  
| _operations tax revenue under the adopted tax rate as compared to_  
| _maintenance and operations tax revenue in the preceding tax year)_  
| _percent in maintenance and operations tax revenue for the district_  
| _for the current year as compared to the preceding year, which is an_  
| _additional $____ (insert dollar amount of increase in maintenance_  
| _and operations tax revenue under the adopted tax rate as compared to_

|  ~~would be distributed to the district under Chapter 42, Education~~  
|  ~~Code, for the school year beginning in the current tax year using~~  
|  ~~that tax rate, would provide the same amount of state funds~~  
|  ~~distributed under Chapter 42, Education Code, and maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations taxes of the district per student in weighted average~~  
|  ~~daily attendance for that school year that would have been~~

| _tax year; or_  
|  _(ii) zero;_  
|  _(D)_ [ ~~(iii)~~ ] the rate that is equal to the sum of  
| the differences for the _2019_ [ ~~2006~~ ] and each subsequent tax year  
| between the adopted tax rate of the district for that year if the

|  [ ~~(iii) the district's current debt rate~~].  
|  _(n-1)_ _____This section applies only to a school district that,_  
| _for the 2018 tax year, adopted a maintenance and operations tax rate_  
| _equal to the sum of the district's tier one maintenance and_

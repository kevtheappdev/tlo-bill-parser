| _reflects and provides financing for costs beyond the control of_  
| _school districts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____adjustments for costs related to the geographic_  
| _variation in known resource costs and costs of education,_  
| _controlling for the impact of unequalized wealth and hold-harmless_

| _concentrations of poverty on the compensation that school districts_  
| _must pay to attract and retain teachers of comparable or_  
| _appropriate quality;_  
|  _(2)_ _____adjustments for costs related to the size and_  
| _diseconomies of scale of school districts;_  
|  _(3)_ _____adjustments for costs related to the varying_

| _turnover rate of personnel and the impact of those factors on_  
| _student achievement in considering the adequacy and comparability_  
| _of salaries;_  
|  _(3)_ _____properly address the impact of factors that have a_  
| _large impact on certain types of school districts, such as extreme_  
| _isolation, regardless of general state impact;_  
|  _(4)_ _____include only factors for which a rational economic_  
| _argument can be made;_  
|  _(5)_ _____be carefully constructed to make sure that a cost_  
| _factor does not significantly affect more than one variable; and_

| _provide a report that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____states the findings of the review conducted under_  
| _this section; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____includes recommendations for updated weights,_  
| _allotments, and adjustments and any other statutory changes_  
| _considered appropriate by the agency._  
|  _(g) This section expires January 1, 2021._  
|  _Sec._ ___42.011._ _____STUDY OF LEGISLATION ON SCHOOL FUNDING. (a)_

| _study assessing the manner in which any statute enacted or amended_  
| _during that legislative session affects the equalized wealth level_  
| _of a school district under Chapter 41 or the foundation school_  
| _program under this chapter and whether the standard of neutrality_  
| _described under Section 42.001(b) is maintained._  
|  _(b) The study under this section must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____include an analysis of the effects of legislation_  
| _on each school district in the state; and_

|  (a) For each student in average daily attendance, not  
| including the time students spend each day in special education  
| programs in an instructional arrangement other than mainstream or  
| career and technology education programs, for which an additional  
| allotment is made under Subchapter C, a district is entitled to an  
| allotment equal to the lesser of _$5,440_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] or the amount that  
| results from the following formula:  
| A = _$5,440_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] X (DCR/MCR)  
| where:  
|  "A" is the allotment to which a district is entitled;  
|  "DCR" is the district's compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax  
| rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year; and  
|  "MCR" is the state maximum compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by $1.50.  
|  SECTION 9. Effective September 1, 2020, Section 42.101,  
| Education Code, is amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding  
| Subsection (a-3) to read as follows:  
|  (a) _Subject to adjustment under Subsection (a-3), for_ [ ~~For~~ ]  
| each student in average daily attendance, not including the time  
| students spend each day in special education programs in an  
| instructional arrangement other than mainstream or career and  
| technology education programs, for which an additional allotment is  
| made under Subchapter C, a district is entitled to an allotment  
| equal to the lesser of _$5,840_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] or the amount that results  
| from the following formula:  
| A = _$5,840_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] X (DCR/MCR)  
| where:  
|  "A" is the allotment to which a district is entitled;  
|  "DCR" is the district's compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax  
| rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year; and  
|  "MCR" is the state maximum compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by $1.50.  
|  _(a-3)_ _____Beginning with the 2021-2022 school year, the basic_  
| _allotment provided to a district under Subsection (a) or (b) is_  
| _adjusted annually to increase the allotment by the greater of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____one percent of the amount of the allotment for the_  
| _preceding school year; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the amount that results from applying the_  
| _inflation rate, as determined by the comptroller on the basis of_  
| _changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers_  
| _published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States_  
| _Department of Labor, to the allotment for the preceding school_  
| _year._  
|  SECTION 10. Sections 42.152(a) and (c), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) For each student who is educationally disadvantaged or  
| who is a student who does not have a disability and resides in a  
| residential placement facility in a district in which the student's  
| parent or legal guardian does not reside, a district is entitled to  
| an annual allotment equal to the adjusted basic allotment  
| multiplied by _0.25_ [ ~~0.2~~ ], and by 2.41 for each full-time equivalent  
| student who is in a _compensatory, intensive, or accelerated_  
| [ ~~remedial and support~~ ] program under Section 29.081 because the  
| student is pregnant.  
|  (c) Funds allocated under this section shall be used to fund  
| supplemental programs and services designed to eliminate any  
| disparity in performance on assessment instruments administered  
| under Subchapter B, Chapter 39, or disparity in the rates of high  
| school completion between students at risk of dropping out of  
| school, as defined by Section 29.081, and all other students.  
| Specifically, the funds, other than an indirect cost allotment  
| established under State Board of Education rule, which may not  
| exceed _25_ [ ~~45~~ ] percent, may be used to meet the costs of providing a  
| compensatory, intensive, or accelerated instruction program under  
| Section 29.081 or a disciplinary alternative education program  
| established under Section 37.008, to pay the costs associated with  
| placing students in a juvenile justice alternative education  
| program established under Section 37.011, or to support a program  
| eligible under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education  
| Act of 1965, as provided by Pub. L. No. 103-382 and its subsequent  
| amendments, and by federal regulations implementing that Act, at a  
| campus at which at least 40 percent of the students are  
| educationally disadvantaged.  In meeting the costs of providing a  
| compensatory, intensive, or accelerated instruction program under  
| Section 29.081, a district's compensatory education allotment  
| shall be used for costs supplementary to the regular education  
| program, such as costs for program and student evaluation,  
| instructional materials and equipment and other supplies required  
| for quality instruction, supplemental staff expenses, salary for  
| teachers of at-risk students, smaller class size, and  
| individualized instruction.  A home-rule school district or an  
| open-enrollment charter school must use funds allocated under  
| Subsection (a) for a purpose authorized in this subsection but is  
| not otherwise subject to Subchapter C, Chapter 29.  For purposes of  
| this subsection, a program specifically designed to serve students  
| at risk of dropping out of school, as defined by Section 29.081, is  
| considered to be a program supplemental to the regular education  
| program, and a district may use its compensatory education  
| allotment for such a program.  
|  SECTION 11. Sections 42.153(a) and (b), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) For each student in average daily attendance in a  
| bilingual education or special language program under Subchapter B,  
| Chapter 29, a district is entitled to an annual allotment equal to  
| the adjusted basic allotment multiplied by _0.25_ [ ~~0.1~~ ].  
|  (b) Funds allocated under this section, other than an  
| indirect cost allotment established under State Board of Education  
| rule, _which may not exceed 25 percent,_ must be used in providing  
| bilingual education or special language programs under Subchapter  
| B, Chapter 29, and must be accounted for under existing agency  
| reporting and auditing procedures.  
|  SECTION 12. Section 42.251(b), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) The program shall be financed by:  
|  (1) ad valorem tax revenue generated by an equalized  
| uniform school district effort;  
|  (2) ad valorem tax revenue generated by local school  
| district effort in excess of the equalized uniform school district  
| effort; _and_  
|  (3) [ ~~state available school funds distributed in~~  
|  ~~accordance with law; and~~  
|  [ ~~(4)~~ ] state funds appropriated for the purposes of  
| public school education and allocated to each district in an amount  
| sufficient to finance the cost of each district's Foundation School  
| Program not covered by other funds specified in this subsection.  
|  SECTION 13. Sections 42.253(a) and (c), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) For each school year the commissioner shall determine:  
|  (1) the amount of money to which a school district is  
| entitled under Subchapters B and C;  
|  (2) the amount of money to which a school district is  
| entitled under Subchapter F;  
|  (3) [ ~~the amount of money allocated to the district~~  
|  ~~from the available school fund;~~  
|  [ ~~(4)~~ ] the amount of each district's tier one local  
| share under Section 42.252; and  
|  _(4)_ [ ~~(5)~~ ] the amount of each district's tier two local  
| share under Section 42.302.  
|  (c) Each school district is entitled to an amount equal to  
| the difference for that district between the sum of Subsections  
| (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the sum of Subsections (a)(3) _and_ [ ~~,~~ ] (a)(4)[
~~,~~  
|  ~~and (a)(5)~~ ].  
|  SECTION 14. Sections 42.302(a) and (a-1), Education Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount  
| per weighted student in state and local funds for each cent of tax  
| effort over that required for the district's local fund assignment  
| up to the maximum level specified in this subchapter. The amount  
| of state support, subject only to the maximum amount under Section  
| 42.303, is determined by the formula:  
| GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR  
| where:  
|  "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be  
| allocated to the district;  
|  "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local  
| funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is an  
| amount described by Subsection (a-1) or a greater amount for any  
| year provided by appropriation;  
|  "WADA" is the number of students in weighted average daily  
| attendance, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the school  
| district's allotments under Subchapters B and C, less any allotment  
| to the district for transportation, any allotment under Section  
| 42.158 [ ~~or 42.160~~ ], and 50 percent of the adjustment under Section  
| 42.102, by the basic allotment for the applicable year;  
|  "DTR" is the district enrichment tax rate of the school  
| district, which is determined by subtracting the amounts specified  
| by Subsection (b) from the total amount of maintenance and  
| operations taxes collected by the school district for the  
| applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient  
| of the district's taxable value of property as determined under  
| Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable,  
| under Section 42.2521, divided by 100; and  
|  "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying  
| "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section 42.2521, divided by 100.  
|  (a-1) For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount  
| guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per  
| cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:  
|  (1) the greater of the amount of district tax revenue  
| per weighted student per cent of tax effort that would be available  
| to the Austin Independent School District _or the amount that would_  
| _be available to a district at the 95th percentile in wealth per_  
| _student_ , as determined by the commissioner in cooperation with the  
| Legislative Budget Board, if the reduction of the limitation on tax  
| increases as provided by Section 11.26(a-1), (a-2), or (a-3), Tax  
| Code, did not apply, [ ~~or the amount of district tax revenue per~~  
|  ~~weighted student per cent of tax effort used for purposes of this~~  
|  ~~subdivision in the preceding school year,~~ ] for the first six cents  
| by which the district's maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds  
| the rate equal to the sum of the product of the state compression  
| percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the  
| maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district for the  
| 2005 tax year and any additional tax effort included in calculating  
| the district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1); and  
|  (2) _the amount of district tax revenue per weighted_  
| _student per cent of tax effort available to a district with_  
| _maintenance and operations tax revenue per cent of tax effort equal_  
| _to the maximum amount provided per cent under Section 42.101(a) or_  
| _(b)_ [ ~~$31.95~~ ], for the district's maintenance and operations tax  
| effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort described by  
| Subdivision (1).  
|  SECTION 15. Effective September 1, 2020, Section  
| 42.302(a-1), Education Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (a-1) For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount  
| guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per  
| cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:  
|  (1) the greater of the amount of district tax revenue

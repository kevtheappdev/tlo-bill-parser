|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a limitation on the total amount of ad valorem taxes  
| that a school district may impose on certain residence homesteads  
| following a substantial school tax increase.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 11, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 11.262 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___11.262._ _____LIMITATION OF SCHOOL TAXES ON CERTAIN_  
| _HOMESTEADS FOLLOWING SUBSTANTIAL TAX INCREASE. (a) In this_  
| _section, "residence homestead" has the meaning assigned by Section_  
| _11.13._  
|  _(b)_ _____The chief appraiser shall appraise, and the tax assessor_  
| _for each school district shall calculate the taxes on, each_  
| _residence homestead in the manner provided by law for other_  
| _property._  
|  _(c)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (g), if an individual_  
| _qualifies property as the individual's residence homestead for at_  
| _least 15 consecutive tax years and the total amount of school_  
| _district taxes imposed on the property in that 15th tax year is at_  
| _least 120 percent greater than the total amount of those taxes_  
| _imposed in the first of those tax years, not including taxes imposed_  
| _on the appraised value of all improvements made to the property_  
| _during that period, a school district may not impose taxes on that_  
| _residence homestead in a subsequent tax year in an amount that_  
| _exceeds the least of the following amounts:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the amount of school taxes calculated for the_  
| _current tax year under Subsection (b);_  
|  _(2)_ _____the amount of school taxes imposed for that 15th_  
| _tax year; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____the amount of school taxes as limited under_  
| _Section 11.26, if applicable._  
|  _(c-1)_ _____An individual may not receive a limitation on taxes_  
| _under Subsection (c) based on an increase in taxes for any period_  
| _that began before the 2006 tax year._  
|  _(d)_ _____If an individual who qualifies for a limitation under_  
| _this section dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is_  
| _entitled to continue receiving the limitation on school taxes_  
| _imposed by a school district on the residence homestead of the_  
| _individual if the property:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse_  
| _on the date that the individual dies; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____remains the residence homestead of the surviving_  
| _spouse._  
|  _(e)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (d) or (f), a_  
| _limitation under this section expires on January 1 if the property_  
| _is not the residence homestead of the individual entitled to the_  
| _limitation for the preceding tax year._  
|  _(f) A limitation under this section does not expire if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____an owner of an interest in the residence homestead_  
| _conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined in Section_  
| _11.13(j) and the owner or the owner's spouse is:_  
|  _(A) a trustor of the trust; and_  
|  _(B) entitled to occupy the property; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the owner of the structure qualifies for an_  
| _exemption under Section 11.13 under the circumstances described by_  
| _Section 11.135(a)._  
|  _(g)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (h), a school district_  
| _may increase the tax on a residence homestead subject to a_  
| _limitation under this section in the first year the appraised value_  
| _of the property is increased as the result of an improvement made to_  
| _the property in the preceding tax year. The amount of the tax_  
| _increase is determined by applying the current tax rate of the_  
| _school district to the difference in the taxable value of the_  
| _property with the improvement and the taxable value the property_  
| _would have had without the improvement. A limitation imposed by_  
| _this section then applies to the increased amount of tax until_  
| _another improvement is made to the property._  
|  _(h)_ _____An improvement to a residence homestead is not treated_  
| _as an improvement under Subsection (g) if the improvement is:_  
|  _(1) a repair;_  
|  _(2)_ _____required to be made to comply with a governmental_  
| _requirement; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____subject to Subsection (i), a replacement structure_  
| _for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a_  
| _casualty or by wind or water damage._  
|  _(i)_ _____A replacement structure described by Subsection (h)(3)_  
| _is considered to be an improvement under Subsection (g) only if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the square footage of the replacement structure_  
| _exceeds the square footage of the replaced structure as the_  
| _replaced structure existed before the casualty or damage occurred;_  
| _or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the exterior of the replacement structure is of_  
| _higher quality construction and composition than that of the_  
| _replaced structure._  
|  _(j)_ _____If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised_  
| _value for a prior year because a limitation under this section was_  
| _erroneously allowed, the tax assessor for the school district shall_  
| _add as back taxes due, as provided by Section 26.09(d), the positive_  
| _difference, if any, between the tax that should have been imposed_  
| _for that tax year and the tax that was imposed because of the_  
| _provisions of this section._  
|  _(k)_ _____For each school district in an appraisal district, the_  
| _chief appraiser shall determine the portion of the appraised value_  
| _of residence homesteads of individuals on which school district_  
| _taxes are not imposed in a tax year because of the limitation under_  
| _this section. That portion is calculated by determining the_  
| _taxable value that, if multiplied by the tax rate adopted by the_  
| _school district for the tax year, would produce an amount equal to_  
| _the amount of tax that would have been imposed by the school_  
| _district on those properties if the limitation under this section_  
| _were not in effect, but that was not imposed because of that_  
| _limitation. The chief appraiser shall determine that taxable value_  
| _and certify it to the comptroller as soon as practicable for each_  
| _tax year._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 23.19(b) and (g), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) If an appraisal district receives a written request for  
| the appraisal of real property and improvements of a cooperative  
| housing corporation according to the separate interests of the  
| corporation's stockholders, the chief appraiser shall separately  
| appraise the interests described by Subsection (d) if the  
| conditions required by Subsections (e) and (f) have been met.  
| Separate appraisal under this section is for the purposes of  
| administration of tax exemptions, determination of applicable  
| limitations of taxes under Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261, _or 11.262,_  
| and apportionment by a cooperative housing corporation of property  
| taxes among its stockholders but is not the basis for determining  
| value on which a tax is imposed under this title. A stockholder  
| whose interest is separately appraised under this section may  
| protest and appeal the appraised value in the manner provided by  
| this title for protest and appeal of the appraised value of other  
| property.  
|  (g) A tax bill or a separate statement accompanying the tax  
| bill to a cooperative housing corporation for which interests of  
| stockholders are separately appraised under this section must  
| state, in addition to the information required by Section 31.01,  
| the appraised value and taxable value of each interest separately  
| appraised. Each exemption claimed as provided by this title by a  
| person entitled to the exemption shall also be deducted from the  
| total appraised value of the property of the corporation. The total  
| tax imposed by a school district, county, municipality, or junior  
| college district shall be reduced by any amount that represents an  
| increase in taxes attributable to separately appraised interests of  
| the real property and improvements that are subject to the  
| limitation of taxes prescribed by Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261 _, or_  
| _11.262_. The corporation shall apportion among its stockholders  
| liability for reimbursing the corporation for property taxes  
| according to the relative taxable values of their interests.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 26.012(6), (13), and (14), Tax Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (6) "Current total value" means the total taxable  
| value of property listed on the appraisal roll for the current year,  
| including all appraisal roll supplements and corrections as of the  
| date of the calculation, less the taxable value of property  
| exempted for the current tax year for the first time under Section  
| 11.31 or 11.315, except that:  
|  (A) the current total value for a school district  
| excludes:  
|  (i) the total value of homesteads that  
| qualify for a tax limitation as provided by _Sections_ [ ~~Section~~ ]  
| 11.26 _and 11.262_ ; and  
|  (ii) new property value of property that is  
| subject to an agreement entered into under Chapter 313; and

| 11.261.  
|  (13) "Last year's levy" means the total of:  
|  (A) the amount of taxes that would be generated  
| by multiplying the total tax rate adopted by the governing body in  
| the preceding year by the total taxable value of property on the  
| appraisal roll for the preceding year, including:  
|  (i) taxable value that was reduced in an  
| appeal under Chapter 42; and  
|  (ii) all appraisal roll supplements and  
| corrections other than corrections made pursuant to Section  
| 25.25(d), as of the date of the calculation, except that last year's  
| taxable value for a school district excludes the total value of  
| homesteads that qualified for a tax limitation as provided by  
| _Sections_ [ ~~Section~~ ] 11.26 _and 11.262_ and last year's taxable value  
| for a county, municipality, or junior college district excludes the  
| total value of homesteads that qualified for a tax limitation as  
| provided by Section 11.261; and

|  (A) last year's taxable value for a school

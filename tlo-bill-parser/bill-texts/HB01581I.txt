|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the sale of electric power to and the imposition of a  
| tax on the gross receipts of electric power for certain public  
| customers.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 182.022, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (d) to read as follows:  
|  _(d)_ _____Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a_  
| _tax under this chapter may not be imposed on the gross receipts from_  
| _the sale of electricity to a public school district customer._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 35.102, Utilities Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsection (c) to read as follows:

| _this section, the General Land Office letterhead, seal, or other_  
| _marketing materials may only be used by a person employed by the_  
| _General Land Office. For the purposes of this section, an employee_  
| _of an entity with which the General Land Office contracts is not_  
| _considered to be employed by the General Land Office._  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter D, Chapter 35, Utilities Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 35.1025 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___35.1025._ _____PUBLIC BID TO SELL POWER TO PUBLIC RETAIL_  
| _CUSTOMERS. (a)_ ___The commissioner may not sell or otherwise convey_  
| _power to a public retail customer unless the commissioner submits a_

| _solicited from multiple power providers to provide power to the_

|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act does not  
| affect taxes imposed before the effective date of this Act, and the  
| law in effect before the effective date of this Act is continued in  
| effect for purposes of the liability for and collection of those  
| taxes.  
|  SECTION 5. (a) As soon as practicable after the effective  
| date of this Act, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, for an  
| electric utility regulated under Chapter 36, Utilities Code, shall  
| provide for the adjustment of the electric utility's billing of a  
| public school district customer to reflect any decrease in the  
| utility's tax liability to this state if the decrease is  
| attributable to the exemption in Section 182.022(d), Tax Code, as  
| added by this Act. An adjustment must be made effective at the same  
| time as the decrease of tax liability or as soon after that decrease  
| occurs as is reasonably practicable. The Public Utility Commission  
| of Texas is not required to provide for an adjustment if the  
| commission enters an order for the utility under Subchapter C or D,  
| Chapter 36, Utilities Code, that accounts for any decrease in the  
| utility's tax liability attributable to the exemption in Section  
| 182.022(d), Tax Code, as added by this Act. An adjustment is not a  
| rate case under Subchapter C or D, Chapter 36, Utilities Code.  
|  (b) As soon as practicable after the effective date of this  
| Act, a retail electric provider, as defined by Section 31.002,  
| Utilities Code, shall adjust the billing of a public school  
| district customer to reflect any decrease in the retail electric  
| provider's tax liability to this state if the decrease is  
| attributable to the exemption in Section 182.022(d), Tax Code, as  
| added by this Act. An adjustment must be made effective at the same  
| time as the decrease of tax liability or as soon after that decrease  
| occurs as is reasonably practicable.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

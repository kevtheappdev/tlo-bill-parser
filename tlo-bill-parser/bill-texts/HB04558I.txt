|  AN ACT  
| relating to the curriculum requirements in government or political  
| science at institutions of higher education.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 51.301, Education Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a) and (b) and adding Subsection (f) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) Every college and university receiving state support or  
| state aid from public funds shall _offer six semester hours or its_  
| _equivalent of_ [ ~~give a~~ ] course [ ~~of~~ ] instruction in government
or  
| political science _, including three semester hours or its equivalent_  
| _of instruction that considers_ [ ~~which includes consideration of~~ ] the  
| Constitution of the United States and _three semester hours or its_  
| _equivalent of instruction that considers_ the constitutions of the  
| states, with special emphasis on that of Texas.  [ ~~This course shall~~  
|  ~~have a credit value of not less than six semester hours or its~~  
|  ~~equivalent.~~ ]  Except as provided by Subsection (c), a college or  
| university receiving state support or state aid from public funds  
| may not grant a baccalaureate degree or _an associate of arts degree_  
| _or associate of science degree_ [ ~~a lesser degree or academic~~  
|  ~~certificate~~ ] to any person unless the person has credit for _the_  
| _instruction required by this subsection_ [ ~~such a course~~ ].  The  
| college or university may determine that a student has satisfied  
| this requirement in whole or in part on the basis of credit granted  
| to the student by the college or university for a substantially  
| equivalent course completed at another accredited college or  
| university or on the basis of the student's successful completion  
| of an advanced standing examination administered on the conditions  
| and under the circumstances common for the college or university's  
| advanced standing examinations.  The college or university may  
| grant as much as three semester hours of credit or its equivalent  
| toward satisfaction of this requirement for substantially  
| equivalent work completed by the student in the program of an  
| approved senior R.O.T.C. unit. _A student is entitled to apply_  
| _course credit not to exceed three semester hours or its equivalent_  
| _in Mexican American politics toward satisfaction of the course_  
| _requirement provided by this subsection._  
|  (b) The requirement of Subsection (a) that the required  
| course _instruction_ must include _three semester hours or its_  
| _equivalent with a_ special emphasis on the Texas Constitution does  
| not apply to a degree granted on completion of an academic program  
| offered by a medical and dental unit, as that term is defined by  
| Section 61.003, to a student who is a member of the armed forces of  
| the United States, including the reserves or national guard, if:  
|  (1) the program is operated by the medical and dental  
| unit under contract with the United States Army;  
|  (2) the program requires less than two years of  
| residency in this state; and  
|  (3) the principal participants in the program are  
| military personnel stationed outside this state.  
|  _(f)_ _____The course requirement provided by Subsection (a) does_  
| _not apply to:_  
|  _(1) an associate of applied science degree; or_  
|  _(2) an academic certificate._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 51.301, Education Code, as amended by  
| this Act, applies to the curriculum requirements established for a  
| degree or certificate program without regard to whether the student  
| initially enrolled in the degree or certificate program before, on,  
| or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

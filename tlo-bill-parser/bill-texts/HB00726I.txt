|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the regulation of groundwater.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 36.113, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (d) and adding Subsection (d-1) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d) This subsection does not apply to the renewal of an  
| operating permit issued under Section 36.1145. Before granting or  
| denying a permit, or a permit amendment issued in accordance with  
| Section 36.1146, the district shall consider whether:  
|  (1) the application conforms to the requirements  
| prescribed by this chapter and is accompanied by the prescribed  
| fees;  
|  (2) the _projected effect of the_ proposed _production_  
| [ ~~use of water~~ ] unreasonably affects _aquifer conditions, artesian_  
| _pressure, depletion, or subsidence,_ existing groundwater and  
| surface water resources _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] existing permit holders _, or_  
| _registered wells that are exempt from the requirement to obtain a_  
| _permit under this chapter or district rules_ ;  
|  (3) the proposed use of water is dedicated to any  
| beneficial use;  
|  (4) the proposed use of water is consistent with the  
| district's approved management plan;  
|  (5) if the well will be located in the Hill Country  
| Priority Groundwater Management Area, the proposed use of water  
| from the well is wholly or partly to provide water to a pond, lake,  
| or reservoir to enhance the appearance of the landscape;  
|  (6) the applicant has agreed to avoid waste and  
| achieve water conservation; and  
|  (7) the applicant has agreed that reasonable diligence  
| will be used to protect groundwater quality and that the applicant  
| will follow well plugging guidelines at the time of well closure.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The district's consideration of the projected effect_  
| _of the proposed production on a registered well described by_  
| _Subsection (d)(2) does not affect a permit exemption for the_  
| _registered well under this chapter or district rules._  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter D, Chapter 36, Water Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 36.1147 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___36.1147._ _____LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY OF RULES. The_  
| _rules of a district in effect on the date an application for a_  
| _permit or a permit amendment is submitted to the district are the_  
| _only district rules that may govern the district's decision to_  
| _grant or deny the application._  
|  SECTION 3. The heading to Section 36.122, Water Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 36.122. _EXPORT_ [ ~~TRANSFER~~ ] OF GROUNDWATER OUT OF  
| DISTRICT.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 36.122, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) and adding  
| Subsections (f-1) and (f-2) to read as follows:  
|  (a) _This section applies to_ [ ~~If~~ ] an application for a permit  
| or an amendment to a permit under Section 36.113 _that_ proposes the  
| _export_ [ ~~transfer~~ ] of groundwater _for use_ outside of a district's  
| boundaries[ ~~, the district may also consider the provisions of this~~  
|  ~~section in determining whether to grant or deny the permit or permit~~  
|  ~~amendment~~ ].  
|  (b) A district may promulgate rules requiring a person to  
| obtain _an operating_ [ ~~a~~ ] permit or an amendment to _an operating_ [
~~a~~ ]  
| permit under Section 36.113 from the district _to produce and export_  
| [ ~~for the transfer of~~ ] groundwater _._ ___A district may not require a_  
| _separate permit for the export of groundwater for use outside_ [ ~~out~~ ]  
| of the district [ ~~to:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~increase, on or after March 2, 1997, the amount of~~  
|  ~~groundwater to be transferred under a continuing arrangement in~~  
|  ~~effect before that date; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~transfer groundwater out of the district on or~~  
|  ~~after March 2, 1997, under a new arrangement~~ ].  
|  (c) Except as provided in _Subsection (e)_ [ ~~Section~~  
|  ~~36.113(e)~~ ], the district may not impose more restrictive  
| _requirements or_ permit conditions on _exporters_ [ ~~transporters~~ ] than  
| the district imposes on [ ~~existing~~ ] in-district users. _A district_  
| _may not deny a permit because the applicant intends to export_  
| _groundwater for use outside of the district._  
|  (d) The district may impose a reasonable fee for processing  
| an application under this section. The fee may not exceed fees that  
| the district imposes for processing other applications under  
| Section 36.113. An application filed _under_ [ ~~to comply with~~ ] this  
| section shall be considered and processed under the same procedures  
| as other applications for permits under Section 36.113 [ ~~and shall~~  
|  ~~be combined with applications filed to obtain a permit for~~  
|  ~~in-district water use under Section 36.113 from the same~~  
|  ~~applicant~~ ].  
|  (e) The district may impose an export fee or surcharge _on_  
| _the holder of an operating permit for water exported for use outside_  
| _of the district_ using one of the following methods:  
|  (1) a fee negotiated between the district and the  
| exporter;  
|  (2) a rate not to exceed the equivalent of the  
| district's tax rate per hundred dollars of valuation for each  
| thousand gallons of water exported from the district or 2.5 cents  
| per thousand gallons of water, if the district assesses a tax rate  
| of less than 2.5 cents per hundred dollars of valuation; or  
|  (3) for a fee-based district, a 50 percent surcharge,  
| in addition to the district's production fee, for water exported  
| from the district.  
|  _(f-1)_ _____A district shall extend a term for a permit issued_  
| _under this section that existed on May 27, 2019, on or before its_  
| _expiration in the manner prescribed by Section 36.1145:_  
|  _(1)_ _____to a term that is not shorter than the term of an_  
| _operating permit for the production of water to be exported that is_  
| _in effect at the time of the extension; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____for each additional term for which that operating_  
| _permit for production is renewed under Section 36.1145 or remains_  
| _in effect under Section 36.1146._  
|  _(f-2)_ _____A permit extended under Subsection (f-1) continues to_  
| _be subject to conditions contained in the permit as issued before_  
| _the extension._  
|  SECTION 5. Chapter 36, Water Code, is amended by adding  
| Subchapter M-1 to read as follows:  
| _SUBCHAPTER M-1. MORATORIUM ON ISSUING PERMIT_  
|  _Sec._ ___36.426._ _____PROCEDURE FOR ADOPTING MORATORIUM. A district_  
| _may not adopt a moratorium on the issuance of a permit or permit_  
| _amendment unless the district:_  
|  _(1)_ _____complies with the notice and hearing procedures_  
| _prescribed by Section 36.427; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____makes written findings supporting the district's_  
| _determination regarding the issuance, including the district's_  
| _justification for imposing the moratorium, if applicable._  
|  _Sec._ ___36.427._ _____NOTICE AND PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENTS. (a) A_  
| _district may impose a moratorium on the issuance of a permit or_  
| _permit amendment only after the district conducts a public hearing_  
| _as provided by this section. The public hearing must provide_  
| _residents of the district and other affected parties an opportunity_  
| _to be heard._  
|  _(b)_ _____The district shall publish notice of the date, time, and_  
| _place of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the_  
| _district on or before the fourth day before the date of the hearing._  
|  _(c)_ _____During the period beginning on the fifth business day_  
| _after the date a notice is published under Subsection (b) and ending_  
| _on the date the district makes its determination under Subsection_  
| _(d), a temporary moratorium is imposed. During that period, a_  
| _district may stop issuing permits or permit amendments._

|  SECTION 6. Sections 36.122(f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k),  
| (l), (m), (n), (o), and (q), Water Code, are repealed.  
|  SECTION 7. A moratorium on the issuance of a permit or  
| permit amendment that is adopted by a groundwater conservation  
| district before September 1, 2019, may not continue in effect after  
| November 30, 2019.  
|  SECTION 8. (a)  A permit to export groundwater approved by a  
| groundwater conservation district before the effective date of this  
| Act is validated and confirmed in all respects.  This subsection  
| does not apply to a permit to export groundwater that is subject to  
| litigation:

| appealed that the permit is invalid.  
|  (b) An administratively complete permit application to  
| export groundwater received by a groundwater conservation district  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in  
| effect when the application became administratively complete.  The

| application received before the effective date of this Act.  
|  (c) A groundwater conservation district that imposed an  
| export fee or surcharge on the holder of a permit to export  
| groundwater before the effective date of this Act may continue to  
| impose the fee or surcharge on the holder for the duration of the  
| permit and any renewal of the permit if the holder of the permit to  
| export groundwater is not the same person who holds the associated  
| operating permit.  
|  SECTION 9. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  ~~Department of Criminal Justice for life without parole or by death.~~

|  ~~death penalty, prospective jurors shall be informed that a sentence~~  
|  ~~of life imprisonment without parole or death is mandatory on~~  
|  ~~conviction of a capital felony. In a capital felony trial in which~~  
|  ~~the state does not seek the death penalty~~ ], prospective jurors  
| shall be informed [ ~~that the state is not seeking the death penalty~~  
|  ~~and~~ ] that:  
|  (1) a sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory on  
| conviction of the capital felony, if the individual committed the  
| offense when younger than 18 years of age; or  
|  (2) a sentence of life imprisonment without parole is  
| mandatory on conviction of the capital felony, if the individual  
| committed the offense when 18 years of age or older.  
|  SECTION 2. Articles 1.13(a) and (b), Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, are amended to read as follows:

| criminal prosecution for any offense _is entitled_ [ ~~other than a~~  
|  ~~capital felony case in which the state notifies the court and the~~  
|  ~~defendant that it will seek the death penalty shall have the right~~ ],  
| upon entering a plea, to waive the right of trial by jury,  
| conditioned, however, that, except as provided by Article 27.19,  
| the waiver must be made in person by the defendant in writing in  
| open court with the consent and approval of the court, and the  
| attorney representing the state. The consent and approval by the  
| court shall be entered of record on the minutes of the court, and  
| the consent and approval of the attorney representing the state  
| shall be in writing, signed by that attorney, and filed in the  
| papers of the cause before the defendant enters the defendant's  
| plea.  
|  (b) In a capital felony case [ ~~in which the attorney~~  
|  ~~representing the State notifies the court and the defendant that it~~  
|  ~~will not seek the death penalty~~ ], the defendant may waive the right  
| to trial by jury but only if the attorney representing the State, in  
| writing and in open court, consents to the waiver.

| criminal court, or county court at law, in which the fine imposed or  
| affirmed by the county court, the county criminal court or county  
| court at law does not exceed one hundred dollars, unless the sole

| determinations shall be final. [ ~~The appeal of all cases in which~~  
|  ~~the death penalty has been assessed shall be to the Court of~~  
|  ~~Criminal Appeals.~~ ] In addition, the Court of Criminal Appeals may,  
| on its own motion, with or without a petition for such discretionary  
| review being filed by one of the parties, review any decision of a

| application is received by that court, a writ of habeas corpus,  
| returnable to the Court of Criminal Appeals, shall issue by  
| operation of law. The clerk of that court shall make appropriate  
| notation thereof, assign to the case a file number (ancillary to  
| that of the conviction being challenged), and forward a copy of the  
| application by certified mail, return receipt requested, by secure  
| electronic mail, or by personal service to the attorney  
| representing the state in that court, who shall answer the  
| application not later than the 15th day after the date the copy of

| the date of or during the convicted person's trial; and  
|  (B) the scientific evidence would be admissible  
| under the Texas Rules of Evidence at a trial held on the date of the

| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:

| judges of the district courts trying felony cases in the county; _and_  
|  (C) [ ~~appointments for defendants in capital~~  
|  ~~cases in which the death penalty is sought comply with the~~

| the total amounts due to each school district and open-enrollment  
| charter school under this chapter [ ~~and the total amounts necessary~~

| districts and schools results in an amount equal to the total  
| adjustment necessary. The following fiscal year _,_ [ ~~:~~

| section is increased by an amount equal to the adjustment made  
| under this subsection[ ~~; and~~

| commissioner to have the district's taxable value of property or ad  
| valorem tax collections adjusted for purposes of this chapter or  
| Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46. The commissioner may make the adjustment only  
| to the extent the commissioner determines that making the

| chapter to exceed the amount appropriated for purposes of the  
| Foundation School Program for that year; and

| adjustment made under this section by making offsetting adjustments  
| in the school district's taxable value of property or ad valorem tax  
| collections for purposes of this chapter or Chapter [ ~~41 or~~ ] 46 on a  
| final determination of the taxable value of property that was the

| withhold the amount paid from the first state money payable to the  
| district.  If the commissioner orders payment from the money  
| appropriated to the Foundation School Program on behalf of a school  
| district that is _not entitled to state assistance under Chapter 42_

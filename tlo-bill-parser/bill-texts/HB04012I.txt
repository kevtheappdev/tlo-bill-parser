|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the procedure for qualifying for the exemption from ad  
| valorem taxation of pollution control property.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.31, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsections (o), (p), and (q) to read as follows:  
|  _(o)_ _____The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall_  
| _adopt by rule a list of property that is used wholly as a facility,_  
| _device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution._  
| _In adopting the list, the commission shall consider whether_  
| _property previously determined by the executive director to be used_  
| _wholly for the control of air, water, or land pollution continues to_  
| _be used wholly for that purpose based on changes in the use of the_  
| _property or changes in environmental regulations._ ___The commission_  
| _shall review the list at least once every five years._ ___Section_  
| _11.43(c) applies to an exemption granted under this section for_  
| _property included on a list adopted by the commission under this_  
| _subsection._ ___The fact that property is included on a list adopted by_  
| _the commission under this subsection and that the executive_  
| _director determined in a prior year that the property was used_  
| _wholly as a facility, device, or method for the control of air,_  
| _water, or land pollution does not preclude the chief appraiser from_  
| _canceling the exemption if the chief appraiser determines that the_  
| _facility, device, or method is no longer installed at the property_  
| _that is subject to the exemption or is no longer used wholly or_  
| _partly for the purposes described by Subsection (b)._  
|  _(p)_ _____An exemption under this section, other than an exemption_  
| _for property included on a list adopted by the Texas Commission on_  
| _Environmental Quality under Subsection (o), expires at the end of_  
| _the fifth tax year after the year in which the executive director_  
| _issues a letter under Subsection (d) stating the executive_  
| _director's determination that the facility, device, or method is_  
| _used wholly or partly to control pollution._ ___To continue to receive_  
| _an exemption under this section after that year, the person seeking_  
| _to renew the exemption must file a new permit application or permit_  
| _exemption request with the executive director under Subsection (c)_  
| _and file a new application for the exemption with the chief_  
| _appraiser._ ___Notwithstanding Section 11.43(d), a permit application_  
| _or permit exemption request under Subsection (c) of this section_  
| _must be filed with the executive director and an application for an_  
| _exemption must be filed with the chief appraiser not later than_  
| _September 1 of the year in which the exemption expires._ ___In addition_  
| _to submitting the information required by Subsection (c), the_  
| _person must provide proof that the facility, device, or method is_  
| _still installed at the property that is subject to the exemption and_  
| _is still used wholly or partly for the purposes described by_  
| _Subsection (b)._ ___The exemption remains in effect until the_  
| _executive director or the commission takes final action on the_  
| _application._ ___An exemption renewed under this subsection expires at_  
| _the end of the fifth tax year after the year in which the executive_  
| _director issues a letter under Subsection (d) stating the executive_  
| _director's determination that the facility, device, or method is_  
| _used wholly or partly to control pollution._  
|  _(q)_ _____This subsection expires September 1, 2025._ __  
| _Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (p) relating to the_  
| _date on which an exemption under this section expires:_  
|  _(1)_ _____an exemption granted under this section before the_  
| _2000 tax year, other than an exemption for property included on a_  
| _list adopted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality under_  
| _Subsection (o), expires at the end of the 2020 tax year unless the_  
| _person seeking to renew the exemption complies with Subsection (p)_  
| _on or before September 1, 2020;_  
|  _(2)_ _____an exemption granted under this section before the_  
| _2005 tax year but not before the 2000 tax year, other than an_  
| _exemption for property included on a list adopted by the Texas_  
| _Commission on Environmental Quality under Subsection (o), expires_  
| _at the end of the 2021 tax year unless the person seeking to renew_  
| _the exemption complies with Subsection (p) on or before September_  
| _1, 2021;_  
|  _(3)_ _____an exemption granted under this section before the_  
| _2011 tax year but not before the 2005 tax year, other than an_  
| _exemption for property included on a list adopted by the Texas_  
| _Commission on Environmental Quality under Subsection (o), expires_  
| _at the end of the 2022 tax year unless the person seeking to renew_  
| _the exemption complies with Subsection (p) on or before September_  
| _1, 2022;_  
|  _(4)_ _____an exemption granted under this section before the_  
| _2013 tax year but not before the 2011 tax year, other than an_  
| _exemption for property included on a list adopted by the Texas_  
| _Commission on Environmental Quality under Subsection (o), expires_  
| _at the end of the 2023 tax year unless the person seeking to renew_  
| _the exemption complies with Subsection (p) on or before September_  
| _1, 2023; and_  
|  _(5)_ _____an exemption granted under this section before the_  
| _2020 tax year but not before the 2013 tax year, other than an_  
| _exemption for property included on a list adopted by the Texas_  
| _Commission on Environmental Quality under Subsection (o), expires_  
| _at the end of the 2024 tax year unless the person seeking to renew_  
| _the exemption complies with Subsection (p) on or before September_  
| _1, 2024._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 11.43(b) and (c), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsection (c) and by Sections  
| 11.184 _, 11.31,_ and 11.437, a person required to apply for an  
| exemption must apply each year the person claims entitlement to the  
| exemption.  
|  (c) An exemption provided by Section 11.13, 11.131, 11.132,  
| 11.133, 11.134, 11.17, 11.18, 11.182, 11.1827, 11.183, 11.19,  
| 11.20, 11.21, 11.22, 11.23(a), (h), (j), (j-1), or (m), 11.231,  
| 11.254, 11.27, 11.271, 11.29, 11.30, [ ~~11.31,~~ ] or 11.315, once  
| allowed, need not be claimed in subsequent years, and except as  
| otherwise provided by Subsection (e), the exemption applies to the  
| property until it changes ownership or the person's qualification  
| for the exemption changes. However, except as provided by  
| Subsection (r), the chief appraiser may require a person allowed  
| one of the exemptions in a prior year to file a new application to  
| confirm the person's current qualification for the exemption by  
| delivering a written notice that a new application is required,  
| accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person  
| previously allowed the exemption. If the person previously  
| allowed the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief  
| appraiser may not cancel the exemption due to the person's failure  
| to file the new application unless the chief appraiser complies  
| with the requirements of Subsection (q), if applicable.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

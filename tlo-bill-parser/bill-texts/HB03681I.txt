|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to preliminary examination periods for mental health  
| protective custody.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 573.021(b), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A person accepted for a preliminary examination may be  
| detained in custody for not longer than _72_ [ ~~48~~ ] hours after the time  
| the person is presented to the facility unless a written order for  
| protective custody is obtained. The _72-hour_ [ ~~48-hour~~ ] period  
| allowed by this section includes any time the patient spends  
| waiting in the facility for medical care before the person receives  
| the preliminary examination. If the _72-hour_ [ ~~48-hour~~ ] period ends  
| on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or before 4 p.m. on the first  
| succeeding business day, the person may be detained until 4 p.m. on  
| the first succeeding business day. If the _72-hour_ [ ~~48-hour~~ ] period  
| ends at a different time, the person may be detained only until 4  
| p.m. on the day the _72-hour_ [ ~~48-hour~~ ] period ends. If extremely  
| hazardous weather conditions exist or a disaster occurs, the  
| presiding judge or magistrate may, by written order made each day,  
| extend by an additional 24 hours the period during which the person  
| may be detained. The written order must declare that an emergency  
| exists because of the weather or the occurrence of a disaster.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 573.021, Health and Safety Code, applies to an emergency detention  
| that begins on or after the effective date of this Act. An emergency  
| detention that begins before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law as it existed immediately before that date, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  _(d)_ _____If an insurer changes the credited interest rate paid on_  
| _a policy's accumulation value more than once during a policy year,_  
| _the insurer is required to provide the notice under Subsection (a)_  
| _only if, after taking into account all changes made to the credited_  
| _interest rate during the policy year, the changes result in an_  
| _overall decrease in the credited interest rate._

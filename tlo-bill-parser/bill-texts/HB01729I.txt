---  
|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the amount of the discount allowed for prepayment of  
| sales and use taxes.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 151.424, Tax Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsections (a-1), (e), and (f)  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) _In addition to the amount permitted to be deducted and_  
| _withheld under Section 151.423, a_ [ ~~A~~ ] taxpayer who prepays the  
| taxpayer's tax liability on the basis of a reasonable estimate of  
| the tax liability for a quarter in which a prepayment is made or for  
| a month in which a prepayment is made may deduct and withhold _the_  
| _lesser of the following, as determined by the comptroller under_  
| _Subsection (e):_  
|  _(1)_ 1.25 percent of the amount of the prepayment _; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____an annually adjusted percentage of the amount of_  
| _the prepayment that yields an annualized rate of return equal to the_  
| _prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the first_  
| _business day of each calendar year, plus four percent_ [ ~~in addition~~
~~~~  
|  ~~to the amount permitted to be~~ ~~~~ ~~deducted and withheld~~ ~~~~
~~under Section~~  
|  ~~151.423 of this~~ ~~~~ ~~code~~ ].  
|  _(a-1)_ A reasonable estimate of the tax liability _under_  
| _Subsection (a)_ must be at least 90 percent of the tax ultimately due  
| or the amount of tax paid in the same quarter, or month, if a monthly  
| prepayer, in the last preceding year.  Failure to prepay a  
| reasonable estimate of the tax will result in the loss of the entire  
| prepayment discount.  
|  _(e)_ _____Not later than January 5 of each year, the comptroller_  
| _shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____determine the percentage of a taxpayer's_  
| _prepayment that may be deducted and withheld under Subsection (a);_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____publish the percentage determined under this_  
| _subsection on the comptroller's Internet website._  
|  _(f)_ _____The percentage determined under Subsection (e) applies_  
| _to a deduction and withholding from a prepayment of tax liability_  
| _that a taxpayer makes on or after January 15 of the year the_  
| _comptroller makes the determination and before January 15 of the_  
| _succeeding year._  
|  SECTION 2. The comptroller of public accounts shall make  
| the initial determination required by Section 151.424(e), Tax Code,  
| as added by this Act, not later than January 5, 2020.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 151.424, Tax Code, as amended by this  
| Act, applies to a prepayment of tax liability made on or after  
| January 15, 2020.  A prepayment of tax liability made before January  
| 15, 2020, is governed by the law in effect immediately preceding the  
| effective date of this Act, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act does not  
| affect tax liability accruing before the effective date of this  
| Act.  That liability continues in effect as if this Act had not been  
| enacted, and the former law is continued in effect for the  
| collection of taxes due and for civil and criminal enforcement of  
| the liability for those taxes.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect October 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the transfer of certain suits affecting the  
| parent-child relationship.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 155.202(a), Family Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) If the basis of a motion to transfer a proceeding under  
| this subchapter is that the child resides in another county, the  
| court may deny the motion if it is shown that the child has resided  
| in that county for less than six months at the time the proceeding  
| is commenced _unless the motion is filed pursuant to Section_  
| _262.203(a-1)_.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 262.203, Family Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsection (a-1) to read as follows:  
|  _(a-1)_ _____On the court's own motion, the court in which a suit_  
| _under this chapter is filed may, in accordance with procedures_  
| _provided by Chapter 155, transfer the suit to a county where the_  
| _child has been placed by the department if the court finds that the_  
| _transfer is necessary for the convenience of the parties and in the_  
| _best interest of the child._  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply to a  
| suit affecting the parent-child relationship filed on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A suit affecting the parent-child  
| relationship filed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the suit was filed, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

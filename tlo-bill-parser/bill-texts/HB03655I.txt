| beneficiary's undergraduate tuition and required fees for which a  
| tuition unit may be redeemed at a particular general academic  
| teaching institution _, medical and dental unit,_ or two-year  
| institution of higher education is assigned to the tuition unit at

| institution of higher education in any academic year in which the  
| unit is redeemed in accordance with this subchapter. The purchaser

| provided by this section, when used to pay the cost of tuition and  
| required fees at a general academic teaching institution _, medical_  
| _and dental unit,_ or two-year institution of higher education, is  
| equal to one percent of the amount necessary for the academic year  
| in which the unit is redeemed to cover the applicable cost of  
| undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for one academic  
| year consisting of 30 semester credit hours as follows:  
|  (1) for a Type I tuition unit, the cost of  
| undergraduate resident tuition and required fees charged by the  
| general academic teaching institution _or medical and dental unit,_  
| _as applicable,_ with the highest such tuition and fee costs,  
| determined as provided by Subsection (d);  
|  (2) for a Type II tuition unit, the weighted average  
| undergraduate resident tuition and required fees charged by general  
| academic teaching institutions _or medical and dental units, as_  
| _applicable_ , determined as provided by Subsection (e); and  
|  (3) for a Type III tuition unit, the weighted average  
| undergraduate resident tuition and required fees of two-year  
| institutions of higher education, determined as provided by  
| Subsection (f).  
|  (c) Each year, the board shall establish the price at which  
| each type of tuition unit may be purchased during the next sales  
| period and the percentage of the total cost of undergraduate  
| resident tuition and required fees for one academic year consisting  
| of 30 semester credit hours for which each type of tuition unit may  
| be redeemed at each general academic teaching institution _, medical_  
| _and dental unit,_ and two-year institution. The percentage shall be  
| based on the total cost of required tuition and fees at a particular  
| general academic teaching institution _, medical and dental unit,_ or  
| two-year institution of higher education in relation to the amount  
| determined for the institution _or unit_ with the highest cost or  
| weighted average cost, as applicable. The purchase price  
| established for each type of unit must be equal to the applicable  
| cost of tuition and required fees as determined under this section  
| for the most recent academic year that began before the beginning of  
| the sales period. The sales period to which those prices apply  
| expires on the first anniversary of the date the units become  
| available for purchase at the prices established for that year. _On_  
| _or before June 1, each general academic teaching institution,_  
| _medical and dental unit, and two-year institution of higher_  
| _education shall annually provide information for the upcoming fall_  
| _semester to the board in a format requested by the board, to assist_  
| _the board in determining tuition unit sales prices for the upcoming_  
| _sales period and redemption values for the upcoming academic year._  
|  (d) The board shall base the purchase price of a Type I  
| tuition unit on one percent of the cost of the undergraduate  
| resident tuition and required fees for the applicable academic year  
| at the general academic teaching institution _or medical and dental_  
| _unit, as applicable,_ with the highest such tuition and fee cost for  
| that academic year.  
|  (e) The board shall base the purchase price of a Type II  
| tuition unit on one percent of the cost of the weighted average  
| general academic teaching institution _or medical and dental unit,_  
| _as applicable,_ undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for  
| the applicable academic year. That cost is determined by:  
|  (1) for each general academic teaching institution _or_  
| _medical and dental unit, as applicable_ , multiplying the average  
| amount of the institution's _or unit's_ undergraduate resident  
| tuition and required fees for an academic year consisting of 30  
| semester credit hours by the number of full-time equivalent  
| undergraduate resident students at that institution _or unit_ ;  
|  (2) adding together the products computed under  
| Subdivision (1) for each institution _or unit_ ; and  
|  (3) dividing the sum determined under Subdivision (2)  
| by the total number of full-time equivalent undergraduate resident  
| students at all general academic teaching institutions _or medical_  
| _and dental units, as applicable_.  
|  SECTION 10. Sections 54.754(a), (b), (c), and (d),  
| Education Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In accordance with this subchapter, when a beneficiary  
| under a prepaid tuition contract redeems one or more tuition units  
| to pay costs of tuition and required fees, the board shall apply  
| money in the fund, in the amount provided by Section 54.765 to pay  
| all or the applicable portion of the costs of the beneficiary's  
| tuition and required fees at the general academic teaching  
| institution, _medical and dental unit,_ two-year institution of  
| higher education, private or independent institution of higher  
| education, or accredited out-of-state institution of higher  
| education in which the beneficiary enrolls. Subject to Subsection  
| (b)(2) and the other provisions of this section, a beneficiary may  
| redeem any type of tuition unit for attendance at an institution _or_  
| _unit_ described by this section. A general academic teaching  
| institution _, medical and dental unit,_ or two-year institution of  
| higher education shall accept the amount transferred to the  
| institution _or unit_ under Section 54.765(c) when the unit or units  
| are redeemed as payment for all or the applicable portion of the  
| beneficiary's tuition and required fees.  
|  (b) To pay for the entire cost of undergraduate resident  
| tuition and required fees for an academic year consisting of 30  
| semester credit hours, redemption of 100 Type I tuition units is  
| required at the general academic teaching institution _or medical_  
| _and dental unit, as applicable,_ with the highest tuition and fee  
| cost as described by Section 54.753(d), redemption of 100 Type II  
| tuition units is required at a general academic teaching  
| institution _or medical and dental unit, as applicable,_ with the  
| applicable tuition and fee cost at the weighted average as  
| described by Subsection (e) of that section, and redemption of 100  
| Type III units is required at a two-year institution of higher  
| education with the applicable tuition and fee cost at the weighted  
| average as described by Subsection (f) of that section. The number  
| of tuition units that must be redeemed to pay for the entire cost of  
| tuition and required fees for an academic year at another general  
| academic teaching institution _, medical and dental unit,_ or two-year  
| institution of higher education may be higher or lower:  
|  (1) in proportion to the amount that the cost of  
| tuition and required fees at that institution _or unit_ is higher or  
| lower than the amount determined for the institution _or unit_ with  
| the highest cost or weighted average cost, as applicable; or  
|  (2) if a more or less valuable type of tuition unit is  
| redeemed.  
|  (c) To assist purchasers in determining the number of  
| tuition units a beneficiary must redeem to cover the costs of  
| tuition and required fees at general academic teaching  
| institutions _, medical and dental units,_ and two-year institutions  
| of higher education, each year the board shall prepare a tuition  
| unit redemption chart and shall post the chart on an Internet  
| website. The chart must show for each general academic teaching  
| institution _, for each medical and dental unit,_ and for each  
| two-year institution of higher education the number of each type of  
| units purchased that year that would be required to cover the cost  
| of tuition and required fees, based on an academic year consisting  
| of 30 semester credit hours.  
|  (d) If a beneficiary redeems fewer tuition units of the type  
| or combination of types necessary to pay the total cost of the  
| beneficiary's tuition and required fees at the general academic  
| teaching institution, _medical and dental unit,_ two-year  
| institution of higher education, private or independent  
| institution of higher education, career school, or accredited  
| out-of-state institution of higher education at which the  
| beneficiary enrolls, the beneficiary is responsible for paying the  
| amount of the difference between the amount of tuition and required  
| fees for which the beneficiary pays through the redemption of one or  
| more tuition units and the total cost of the beneficiary's tuition  
| and required fees at the institution _or unit_.

| determined as if the beneficiary of that contract were a resident  
| student.

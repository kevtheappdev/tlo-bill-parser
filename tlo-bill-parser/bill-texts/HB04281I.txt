|  SECTION 7. Section 162.012, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 162.012. PRESUMPTIONS. (a) A person licensed under  
| this chapter or required to be licensed under this chapter, or other  
| user, who fails to keep a record, issue an invoice, or file a return  
| or report required by this chapter is presumed to have sold or used  
| for taxable purposes all motor fuel shown by an audit by the  
| comptroller to have been sold to the license holder or other  
| user. Motor fuel unaccounted for is presumed to have been sold or  
| used for taxable purposes.  
|  _(b)_ If an exporter claims an exemption under Section  
| 162.104(a)(4) or 162.204(a)(4) and fails to report subsequent

| exemption was claimed as required by Section 162.1155 or 162.2165,  
| or to produce proof of payment of tax to the destination state or  
| proof that the transaction was exempt in the destination state, the

| the tax imposed by this chapter on the motor fuel against the  
| exporter.  
|  _(c)_ _____If a person claims an exemption from the county motor_  
| _fuels tax and fails to produce proof of delivery to a nontaxing_  
| _county, the person is presumed to have delivered the motor fuel to a_  
| _taxing county that imposes the tax on motor vehicle fuels_  
| _authorized by Chapter 616, Local Government Code._  
|  _(d)_ The comptroller may fix or establish the amount of  
| taxes, penalties, and interest due this state from the records of  
| deliveries or from any records or information available. If a tax  
| claim, as developed from this procedure, is not paid, after the  
| opportunity to request a redetermination, the claim and any audit  
| made by the comptroller or any report filed by the license holder or  
| other user is evidence in any suit or judicial proceedings filed by  
| the attorney general and is prima facie evidence of the correctness  
| of the claim or audit. A prima facie presumption of the  
| correctness of the claim may be overcome at the trial by evidence  
| adduced by the license holder or other user.  
|  _(e)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] In the absence of records showing the number of  
| miles actually operated per gallon of motor fuel consumed, it is  
| presumed that not less than one gallon of motor fuel was consumed  
| for every four miles traveled. An interstate trucker may produce  
| evidence of motor fuel consumption to establish another mileage  
| factor. If an examination or audit made by the comptroller from the  
| records of an interstate trucker shows that a greater amount of  
| motor fuel was consumed than was reported by the interstate trucker  
| for tax purposes, the interstate trucker is liable for the tax,  
| penalties, and interest on the additional amount shown or the  
| trucker is entitled to a credit or refund on overpayments of tax  
| established by the audit.

| or diesel fuel at each business location on which _a tax_ [ ~~the taxes~~ ]  
| imposed by this chapter at a previous rate _has_ [ ~~have~~ ] been paid  
| shall report to the comptroller the volume of that gasoline and  
| diesel fuel, and at the time of the report shall pay a tax on that  
| gasoline and diesel fuel at a rate equal to the rate of the tax  
| increase.  
|  (b) On the effective date of a reduction of the _rate_ [ ~~rates~~ ]  
| of _a tax_ [ ~~taxes~~ ] imposed by this chapter, a distributor or dealer  
| that possesses for the purpose of sale 2,000 or more gallons of  
| gasoline or diesel fuel at each business location on which _a tax_  
| [ ~~the taxes~~ ] imposed by this chapter at the previous rate _has_ [
~~have~~ ]  
| been paid becomes entitled to a refund in an amount equal to the  
| difference in the amount of _the tax_ [ ~~taxes~~ ] paid on that gasoline or  
| diesel fuel at the previous rate and at the rate in effect on the  
| effective date of the reduction in the tax _rate_ [ ~~rates~~ ]. The rules  
| of the comptroller shall provide for the method of claiming a refund  
| under this chapter and may require that the refund for the dealer be  
| paid through the distributor or supplier from whom the dealer  
| received the fuel.

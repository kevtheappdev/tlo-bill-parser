| a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of the  
| _individual's_ [ ~~his~~ ] residence homestead _or of a fixed dollar amount_  
|  
| if the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit  
| before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by  
| the body. If the percentage set by the taxing unit produces an  
| exemption in a tax year of less than $5,000 _, or of a greater dollar_  
| _amount not to exceed $25,000 adopted by the governing body before_  
| _July 1 of that tax year in the manner provided by law for official_  
| _action by the body,_ when applied to a particular residence  
| homestead, the individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 _or,_  
| _if applicable, of the greater dollar amount adopted by the_  
| _governing body,_ of the appraised value. The percentage adopted by  
| the taxing unit may not exceed _30_ [ ~~20~~ ] percent.

| for a tax year that begins on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the governing body of a  
| political subdivision that adopts an exemption from ad valorem  
| taxation of a percentage of the market value of an individual's  
| residence homestead to set the minimum dollar amount of the  
| exemption to which an individual is entitled in a tax year is  
| approved by the voters. If that amendment is not approved by the  
| voters, this Act has no effect.

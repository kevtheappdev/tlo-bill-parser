| _mother's and child's presence on the premises_ [ ~~mother~~ ] is
_otherwise_  
| authorized [ ~~to be~~ ]. _The authorization may not be revoked solely_

| _against interference with or restriction of that right as provided_  
| _by Section 165.002._

| _entitled to obtain:_  
|  _(1) injunctive relief;_  
|  _(2)_ _____damages in an amount not to exceed $500 for each_  
| _day the violation occurs; and_  
|  _(3) reasonable attorney's fees and court costs._  
|  _(c)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a person liable for_  
| _damages under Subsection (b)(2) is liable for only one award of $500_  
| _for each day a violation of Section 165.002 occurs, and for all_  
| _violations of Section 165.002 the person commits on that day,_  
| _regardless of the number of violations alleged or the number of_  
| _mothers alleging a violation._ ___A mother may recover only one award_  
| _for damages for each day a violation of Section 165.002 occurs,_  
| _regardless of the number of persons who violate that section._

| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the authority of the commissioners court of a county to  
| impose an additional vehicle registration fee and the effect of the  
| fee on county ad valorem tax rates.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 26.01(c) and (d), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the  
| assessor for each taxing unit a listing of those properties which  
| are taxable by that unit but which are under protest and therefore  
| not included on the appraisal roll approved by the appraisal review  
| board and certified by the chief appraiser. This listing shall  
| include the appraised market value, productivity value (if  
| applicable), and taxable value as determined by the appraisal  
| district and shall also include the market value, taxable value,  
| and productivity value (if applicable) as claimed by the property  
| owner filing the protest if available. If the property owner does  
| not claim a value and the appraised value of the property in the  
| current year is equal to or less than its value in the preceding  
| year, the listing shall include a reasonable estimate of the market  
| value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) that  
| would be assigned to the property if the taxpayer's claim is upheld.  
| If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value  
| of the property is higher than its appraised value in the preceding  
| year, the listing shall include the appraised market value,  
| productivity value (if applicable) _,_ and taxable value of the  
| property in the preceding year, except that if there is a reasonable  
| likelihood that the appraisal review board will approve a lower  
| appraised value for the property than its appraised value in the  
| preceding year, the chief appraiser shall make a reasonable  
| estimate of the taxable value that would be assigned to the property  
| if the property owner's claim is upheld. The taxing unit shall use  
| the lower value for calculations as prescribed in Sections 26.04 _,_  
| [ ~~and~~ ] 26.041 _, and 26.042_ [ ~~of this code~~ ].  
|  (d) The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the  
| assessor for each taxing unit a list of those properties of which  
| the chief appraiser has knowledge that are reasonably likely to be  
| taxable by that _taxing_ unit but that are not included on the  
| appraisal roll certified to the assessor under Subsection (a) or  
| included on the listing certified to the assessor under Subsection  
| (c). The chief appraiser shall include on the list for each  
| property the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of  
| any partial exemptions as determined by the appraisal district for  
| the preceding year and a reasonable estimate of the market value,  
| appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions for  
| the current year. Until the property is added to the appraisal  
| roll, the assessor for the taxing unit shall include each property  
| on the list in the calculations prescribed by Sections 26.04 _,_ [ ~~and~~ ]  
| 26.041, _and 26.042,_ and for that purpose shall use the lower market  
| value, appraised value, or taxable value, as appropriate, included  
| on or computed using the information included on the list for the  
| property.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 26.04(e), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (e) By August 7 or as soon thereafter as practicable, the  
| designated officer or employee shall submit the rates to the  
| governing body. _The designated officer or employee_ [ ~~He~~ ] shall  
| deliver by mail to each property owner in the _taxing_ unit or publish  
| in a newspaper in the form prescribed by the comptroller:  
|  (1) the effective tax rate, the rollback tax rate, and  
| an explanation of how they were calculated;  
|  (2) the estimated amount of interest and sinking fund  
| balances and the estimated amount of maintenance and operation or  
| general fund balances remaining at the end of the current fiscal  
| year that are not encumbered with or by corresponding existing debt  
| obligation;  
|  (3) a schedule of the _taxing_ unit's debt obligations  
| showing:  
|  (A) the amount of principal and interest that  
| will be paid to service the _taxing_ unit's debts in the next year  
| from property tax revenue, including payments of lawfully incurred  
| contractual obligations providing security for the payment of the  
| principal of and interest on bonds and other evidences of  
| indebtedness issued on behalf of the _taxing_ unit by another  
| political subdivision and, if the _taxing_ unit is created under  
| Section 52, Article III, or Section 59, Article XVI, Texas  
| Constitution, payments on debts that the _taxing_ unit anticipates to  
| incur in the next calendar year;  
|  (B) the amount by which taxes imposed for debt  
| are to be increased because of the _taxing_ unit's anticipated  
| collection rate; and  
|  (C) the total of the amounts listed in Paragraphs  
| (A)-(B), less any amount collected in excess of the previous year's  
| anticipated collections certified as provided in Subsection (b);  
|  (4) the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue  
| anticipated in calculations under Section 26.041;  
|  _(4-a)_ _____the amount of additional vehicle registration_

| as applicable, in the amount of taxes imposed by the _taxing_ unit as  
| compared to last year's levy, and the amount of the increase or  
| decrease;  
|  (6) in the year that a taxing unit calculates an  
| adjustment under Subsection (i) or (j), a schedule that includes  
| the following elements:  
|  (A) the name of the _taxing_ unit discontinuing the  
| department, function, or activity;  
|  (B) the amount of property tax revenue spent by  
| the _taxing_ unit listed under Paragraph (A) to operate the  
| discontinued department, function, or activity in the 12 months  
| preceding the month in which the calculations required by this  
| chapter are made; and  
|  (C) the name of the _taxing_ unit that operates a  
| distinct department, function, or activity in all or a majority of  
| the territory of a taxing unit that has discontinued operating the

|  SECTION 3. Chapter 26, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Section 26.042 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___26.042._ _____TAX RATE OF COUNTY IMPOSING ADDITIONAL MOTOR_  
| _VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE. (a) In the first year in which a county_  
| _imposes an additional vehicle registration fee under Section_  
| _502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, the effective tax rate and_  
| _rollback tax rate for the county are calculated according to the_  
| _following formulas:_  
|  _EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY_  
| _LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] -_  
| _ADDITIONAL VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE GAIN RATE_  
| _and_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE = (EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE AND_  
| _OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + CURRENT DEBT RATE -_  
| _ADDITIONAL VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE GAIN RATE_  
| _where "additional vehicle registration fee gain rate" means a_  
| _number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated_  
| _by dividing the anticipated revenue generated by the imposition of_  
| _the additional vehicle registration fee authorized under Section_  
| _502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, in the following year as_  
| _calculated under Subsection (d) of this section by the current_  
| _total value._  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c) of this_  
| _section, in a year in which a county imposes an additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee under Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code,_  
| _the rollback tax rate for the county is calculated according to the_  
| _following formula:_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND_  
| _OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW_  
| _PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - ADDITIONAL_  
| _VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE RATE)_  
| _where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the_  
| _amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and_  
| _additional vehicle registration fees authorized under Section_  
| _502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, in the preceding year, and_  
| _"additional vehicle registration fee rate" means a number expressed_  
| _in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the_  
| _revenue that will be generated by the imposition of the additional_  
| _vehicle registration fee authorized under Section 502.401(a-1),_  
| _Transportation Code, in the current year as calculated under_  
| _Subsection (d) of this section by the current total value._  
|  _(c)_ _____In a year in which a county that has been imposing an_  
| _additional vehicle registration fee under Section 502.401(a-1),_  
| _Transportation Code, ceases to impose the fee, the effective tax_  
| _rate and rollback tax rate for the county are calculated according_  
| _to the following formulas:_  
|  _EFFECTIVE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY_  
| _LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] +_  
| _ADDITIONAL VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE LOSS RATE_  
| _and_  
|  _ROLLBACK TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND_  
| _OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW_  
| _PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE_  
| _where "additional vehicle registration fee loss rate" means a_  
| _number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated_  
| _by dividing the amount of revenue generated by the imposition of the_  
| _additional vehicle registration fee authorized under Section_  
| _502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, in the preceding year by the_  
| _current total value, and "last year's maintenance and operations_  
| _expense" means the amount spent for maintenance and operations from_  
| _property tax and additional vehicle registration fees authorized_  
| _under Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, in the preceding_  
| _year._  
|  _(d)_ _____In order to determine the amount of revenue generated by_  
| _the imposition of the additional vehicle registration fee under_  
| _Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, for purposes of this_  
| _section the designated officer or employee shall use the amount of_  
| _the additional vehicle registration fee imposed under that_  
| _subsection in the current year and the number of vehicles_  
| _registered in the county for the preceding year to project the_  
| _additional vehicle registration fee revenue for the current tax_  
| _year. If the amount of the additional vehicle registration fee is_  
| _increased or reduced, the projection to be used for the first tax_  
| _year after the effective date of the increase or reduction shall be_  
| _adjusted to exclude any revenue gained or lost due to the increase_  
| _or reduction._ ___The designated officer or employee may request from_  
| _the appropriate county assessor-collector the number of vehicle_  
| _registrations in the county in the applicable year._ ___The county_  
| _assessor-collector shall provide the requested information._  
|  _(e)_ _____If the amount of the additional vehicle registration fee_  
| _authorized under Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, is_  
| _increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two_  
| _projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) of this_  
| _section, of the revenue generated by the additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee in the following year. The first projection must_  
| _take into account the increase and the second projection must not_  
| _take into account the increase. The officer or employee shall then_  
| _subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from the_  
| _amount of the result of the first projection to determine the_  
| _revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional_  
| _vehicle registration fee. In the first year in which an additional_  
| _vehicle registration fee is increased, the effective tax rate for_  
| _the county is the effective tax rate before the increase minus a_  
| _number the numerator of which is the revenue generated as a result_  
| _of the increase in the additional vehicle registration fee, as_  
| _determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is_  
| _the current total value minus the new property value._  
|  _(f)_ _____If the amount of the additional vehicle registration fee_  
| _authorized under Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code, is_  
| _decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two_  
| _projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d) of this_  
| _section, of the revenue generated by the additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee in the following year. The first projection must_  
| _take into account the decrease and the second projection must not_  
| _take into account the decrease. The officer or employee shall then_  
| _subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from the_  
| _amount of the result of the second projection to determine the_  
| _revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee. In the first year in which an additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee is decreased, the effective tax rate for the_  
| _county is the effective tax rate before the decrease plus a number_  
| _the numerator of which is the revenue lost as a result of the_  
| _decrease in the additional vehicle registration fee, as determined_  
| _under this subsection, and the denominator of which is the current_  
| _total value minus the new property value._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 26.05(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) The governing body of each taxing unit, before the later  
| of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified  
| appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit, shall adopt a tax  
| rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the  
| _taxing_ unit of the rate adopted. The tax rate consists of two  
| components, each of which must be approved separately. The  
| components are:  
|  (1) for a taxing unit other than a school district, the  
| rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the  
| total amount published under Section 26.04(e)(3)(C), less any  
| amount of additional sales and use tax revenue _or additional_  
| _vehicle registration fee revenue_ that will be used to pay debt  
| service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated under  
| Section 44.004(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and  
|  (2) the rate that, if applied to the total taxable  
| value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance  
| and operation expenditures of the _taxing_ unit for the next year.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 31.01, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (i-2) to read as follows:  
|  _(i-2)_ _____For a county that imposes an additional vehicle_  
| _registration fee under Section 502.401(a-1), Transportation Code,_  
| _the tax bill shall indicate the amount of additional ad valorem_  
| _taxes, if any, that would have been imposed on the property if_  
| _additional ad valorem taxes had been imposed in an amount equal to_  
| _the amount of revenue estimated to be collected from the additional_  
| _vehicle registration fee for the year determined as provided by_  
| _Section 26.042 of this code._  
|  SECTION 6. Section 502.401, Transportation Code, is amended  
| by adding Subsection (a-1) to read as follows:  
|  _(a-1)_ _____In addition to the fee authorized under Subsection_  
| _(a), the commissioners court of a county by order may impose an_  
| _additional fee, not to exceed $15, for registering a vehicle in the_  
| _county._  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

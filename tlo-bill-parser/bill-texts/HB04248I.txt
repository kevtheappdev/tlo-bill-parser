(g) is  
| equal to twice the regular filing fee or recording fee provided by  
| statute for that page. [ ~~However, the failure of a page to meet the~~  
|  ~~following requirements does not result in a fee increase under this~~  
|  ~~subsection:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the requirement prescribed by Subsection (b)(3)~~  
|  ~~relating to type size; and~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~provided that the legal paper complies with~~

|  ~~Subsection (c) that a legal paper have a clearly identifying~~  
|  ~~heading.~~ ]  
|  (k) This section does not authorize a county clerk to refuse  
| to record a legal paper for the reason that it fails to meet one or  
| more of the requirements prescribed by _Subsection_ [ ~~Subsections~~ ]  
| (b) _, (c), (e), (f), or_ [ ~~through~~ ] (g). Failure to comply with these  
| requirements shall not in any manner alter, amend, impair, or  
| invalidate any document or legal instrument of any type or  
| character and upon recordation by the county clerk the document or  
| legal instrument shall be deemed and considered as fully complying  
| with the provisions of law dealing with the recordation of  
| documents or legal instruments of every type and character.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 191.007(i) and (j), Local Government  
| Code, are repealed.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies to a  
| legal paper filed with a county clerk on or after September 1, 2019.  
| A legal paper filed with a county clerk before September 1, 2019, is  
| governed by the law in effect at the time the paper was filed, and  
| the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

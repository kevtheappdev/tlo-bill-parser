|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the allocation of housing tax credits to developments  
| within proximate geographical areas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2306.6711(f), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (f) The board may allocate housing tax credits to more than  
| one development in a single community, as defined by department  
| rule, in the same calendar year [ ~~only~~ ] if the developments are or  
| will be located more than two linear miles apart _or the applicant_  
| _obtains prior approval of the development from the governing body_  
| _of the municipality containing the development or, if located_  
| _outside a municipality, the county containing the development_.  
| This subsection _does not prohibit the department from adopting_  
| _rules under this chapter for specific geographic areas of this_  
| _state_ [ ~~applies only to communities contained within counties with~~  
|  ~~populations exceeding one million~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an application for low income housing tax credits that is submitted  
| to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs during an  
| application cycle that is based on the 2020 qualified allocation  
| plan or a subsequent plan adopted by the governing board of the  
| department. An application that is submitted during an application  
| cycle that is based on an earlier qualified allocation plan is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the application cycle  
| began, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

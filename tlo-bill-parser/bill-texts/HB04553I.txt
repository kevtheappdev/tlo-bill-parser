|  AN ACT  
| relating to the certificate of convenience and need  
| decertification.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 13.255, Sec. (c) Water Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) The utility commission [ ~~shall~~ ] _may_ grant single  
| certification to the municipality _unless the utility commission_  
| _makes an express finding that the municipality failed to_  
| _demonstrate the retail public utility is not capable of providing_  
| _service to the proposed decertified area on a continuous and_  
| _adequate basis and supports each of its findings and conclusions_  
| _based solely on the information provided by the municipality and_  
| _the retail public utility_.  _If t_ he utility commission _grants single_  
| _certification to the municipality, the utility commission_ shall  
| [ ~~also determine whether single certification as requested by the~~  
|  ~~municipality would result in property of a retail public utility~~  
|  ~~being rendered useless or valueless to the retail public utility,~~  
|  ~~and shall~~ ] determine in its order the monetary amount that is  
| adequate and just to compensate the retail public utility for such  
| property. If the municipality in its application has requested the  
| transfer of specified property of the retail public utility to the  
| municipality or to a franchised utility, the utility commission  
| shall also determine in its order the adequate and just  
| compensation to be paid for such property pursuant to the  
| provisions of this section, including an award for damages to  
| property remaining in the ownership of the retail public utility  
| after single certification. The order of the utility commission  
| shall not be effective to transfer property.  _The retail public_  
| _utility may appeal the utility commission ruling in a separate_  
| _appeals hearing before the utility commission._  
|  A transfer of  
| property may only be obtained under this section by a court judgment  
| rendered pursuant to Subsection (d) or (e). The grant of single  
| certification by the utility commission shall go into effect on the  
| date the municipality or franchised utility, as the case may be,  
| pays adequate and just compensation pursuant to court order, or  
| pays an amount into the registry of the court or to the retail  
| public utility under Subsection (f). If the court judgment provides  
| that the retail public utility is not entitled to any compensation,  
| the grant of single certification shall go into effect when the  
| court judgment becomes final. The municipality or franchised  
| utility must provide to each customer of the retail public utility  
| being acquired an individual written notice within 60 days after  
| the effective date for the transfer specified in the court  
| judgment. The notice must clearly advise the customer of the  
| identity of the new service provider, the reason for the transfer,  
| the rates to be charged by the new service provider, and the  
| effective date of those rates.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

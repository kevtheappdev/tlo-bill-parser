|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a cancer clinical trial participation program.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) the ability to translate medical findings from  
| research to practice relies largely on robust subject participation  
| and a diverse subject participation pool in clinical trials;  
|  (2) diverse subject participation in cancer clinical  
| trials depends partly on whether an individual is able to afford  
| ancillary costs, including transportation and lodging, during the  
| course of participation in a cancer clinical trial;  
|  (3) a national study conducted in 2015 found that  
| individuals from households with an annual income of less than  
| $50,000 were less likely to participate in cancer clinical trials;  
|  (4) direct and indirect costs, including  
| transportation, lodging, and child-care expenses, prevent eligible  
| individuals from participating in cancer clinical trials according  
| to the National Cancer Institute;  
|  (5) the disparities in subject participation in cancer  
| clinical trials threaten the basic ethical underpinning of clinical  
| research, which requires the benefits of the research to be made  
| available equitably among all eligible individuals;  
|  (6) while the United States Food and Drug  
| Administration recently confirmed to Congress that reimbursement  
| of direct subject-incurred expenses is not an inducement, many  
| organizations, research sponsors, philanthropic individuals,  
| charitable organizations, governmental entities, and other persons  
| still believe that such reimbursement is an inducement;  
|  (7) it is the intent of the legislature to enact  
| legislation to further define and establish a clear difference  
| between items considered to be an inducement for a subject to  
| participate in a cancer clinical trial and the reimbursement of  
| expenses for participating in a cancer clinical trial; and  
|  (8) further clarification of the United States Food  
| and Drug Administration's confirmation is appropriate and  
| important to improve subject participation in cancer clinical  
| trials, which is the primary intent of this legislation.  
|  SECTION 2. Subtitle B, Title 2, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by adding Chapter 50 to read as follows:

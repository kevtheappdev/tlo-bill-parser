|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to municipal disannexation involving certain real estate  
| subdivisions.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter G, Chapter 43, Local Government Code,  
| is amended by adding Section 43.1435 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___43.1435._ _____DISANNEXATION BY PETITION:_ ___CERTAIN REAL_  
| _ESTATE SUBDIVISIONS. (a) This section applies only to an area that_  
| _constitutes a portion of a real estate subdivision that is:_  
|  _(1)_ _____located in and contiguous to the boundary of a_  
| _municipality;_  
|  _(2)_ _____under the jurisdiction of a property owners'_  
| _association that governs the entire real estate subdivision; and_  
|  _(3) either:_  
|  _(A)_ _____subject to a legal determination that the_  
| _municipality failed to provide or agree to provide adequate_  
| _services to the area; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____adjacent to another area in the subdivision_  
| _that is subject to a legal determination described by Paragraph_  
| _(A)._  
|  _(b)_ _____A majority of the registered voters of an area subject_  
| _to this section may petition the municipality to disannex the area._  
| _The petition must be filed with the secretary or clerk of the_  
| _municipality._  
|  _(c)_ _____Not later than the 10th day after the date the secretary_  
| _or clerk receives the petition under Subsection (b), the secretary_  
| _or clerk shall determine whether the petition is valid._ ___If the_  
| _petition is determined valid, the governing body of the_  
| _municipality shall immediately enter in the minutes or records of_  
| _the municipality an order discontinuing the area as part of the_  
| _municipality. The area ceases to be a part of the municipality on_  
| _the date of the entry of the order._  
|  _(d)_ _____A disannexation under this section does not authorize_  
| _the impairment of a municipal debt obligation and, to the extent_  
| _applicable, the area is not released from its pro rata share of that_  
| _indebtedness. The governing body shall continue to levy a property_  
| _tax each year on the property in the area at the same rate that is_  
| _levied on other property in the municipality until the taxes_  
| _collected from the area equal its pro rata share of the_  
| _indebtedness. Those taxes may be charged only with the cost of_  
| _levying and collecting the taxes, and the taxes shall be applied_  
| _exclusively to the payment of the pro rata share of the_  
| _indebtedness. This subsection does not prevent the inhabitants of_  
| _the area from paying in full at any time their pro rata share of the_  
| _indebtedness._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

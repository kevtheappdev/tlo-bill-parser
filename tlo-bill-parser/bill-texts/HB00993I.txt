|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter A, Chapter 92, Property Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 92.0132 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___92.0132._ _____NOTICE REGARDING FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD_  
| _DAMAGE._ _____(a)_ _____In this section, "floodplain" means any area of
land_  
| _that is located in a 100-year floodplain or a 500-year floodplain as_  
| _determined by the most recent flood hazard map published by the_  
| _Federal Emergency Management Agency under the National Flood_  
| _Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001 et seq.)._  
|  _(b) This section applies only to a dwelling that:_  
|  _(1) is located in a floodplain; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____has been damaged by flooding due to rainfall or_  
| _storm surge during the 20 years preceding the date of the lease._  
|  _(c)_ _____Before entering into a lease with a prospective tenant,_  
| _a landlord or landlord's agent must inform the prospective tenant_  
| _in a written notice, signed by both the landlord or landlord's agent_  
| _and the prospective tenant, that the dwelling that is the subject of_  
| _the lease:_  
|  _(1) is located in a floodplain; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____has been previously damaged by flooding due to_  
| _rainfall or storm surge._  
|  _(d)_ _____If a landlord or a landlord's agent violates this_  
| _section and a tenant suffers loss of or damage to the tenant's_  
| _personal property as a result of a flood, the tenant:_  
|  _(1)_ _____may terminate the lease or maintain possession of_  
| _the premises under the terms of the lease; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____is entitled to recover from the landlord the_  
| _following amounts, less any delinquent rent or other sum for which_  
| _the tenant is liable to the landlord:_  
|  _(A) the tenant's actual damages;_  
|  _(B)_ _____the greater of one month's rent or $1,000;_  
| _and_  
|  _(C)_ _____reasonable attorney's fees and court costs_  
| _incurred in recovering the amounts in Paragraphs (A) and (B)._  
|  _(e)_ _____It is a defense to liability under this section that, at_  
| _the time the parties entered into the lease, the landlord or_  
| _landlord's agent did not know that the dwelling that is the subject_  
| _of the lease was located in a floodplain or had been previously_  
| _damaged by flooding._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a lease entered into on or after the effective date of this Act. A  
| lease entered into before that date is governed by the law  
| applicable to the lease immediately before the effective date of  
| this Act, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

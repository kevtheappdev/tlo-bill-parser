|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to exempting the intrastate manufacture of a firearm, a  
| firearm accessory, or ammunition from federal regulation.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The Legislature of the State of Texas finds that:  
|  (1) The Tenth Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution reserves to the states and the people all powers not  
| granted to the federal government elsewhere in the constitution, as  
| those powers were understood at the time that Texas was admitted to  
| statehood in 1845. The guaranty of those powers is a matter of  
| contract between the state and people of Texas and the United States  
| dating from the time Texas became a state.  
|  (2) The Ninth Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution guarantees to the people rights not enumerated in the  
| constitution, as those rights were understood at the time Texas  
| became a state. The guaranty of those rights is a matter of contract  
| between the state and people of Texas and the United States dating  
| from the time Texas became a state.  
|  (3) The regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in  
| the states under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United States  
| Constitution if not expressly preempted by federal law. The United  
| States Congress has not expressly preempted state regulation of  
| intrastate commerce relating to the manufacture on an intrastate  
| basis of firearms, firearms accessories, and ammunition.  
|  (4) The Second Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution guarantees the right of the people to keep and bear  
| arms, as that right was understood at the time Texas became a state.  
| The guaranty of that right is a matter of contract between the state  
| and people of Texas and the United States dating from the time Texas  
| became a state.  
|  (5) Section 23, Article I, Texas Constitution, secures  
| to Texas citizens the right to keep and bear arms. That  
| constitutional protection is unchanged from the date the  
| constitution was adopted in 1876.  
|  SECTION 2. The Legislature of the State of Texas declares  
| that a firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition manufactured in  
| Texas, as described by Chapter 2003, Business & Commerce Code, as  
| added by this Act, that remains within the borders of Texas:  
|  (1) has not traveled in interstate commerce; and  
|  (2) is not subject to federal law or federal  
| regulation, including registration, under the authority of the  
| United States Congress to regulate interstate commerce.  
|  SECTION 3. Title 99, Business & Commerce Code, is amended by  
| adding Chapter 2003 to read as follows:

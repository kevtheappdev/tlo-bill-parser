| relating to a franchise tax credit for enterprise projects for

|  SECTION 1. Chapter 171, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subchapter U to read as follows:

| _CAPITAL INVESTMENTS_  
|  _Sec. 171.9221. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Enterprise project" means a person designated as_  
| _an enterprise project under Chapter 2303, Government Code, on or_  
| _after September 1, 2003._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Qualified business"_ ___has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 2303.003, Government Code._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Qualified capital investment" means tangible_  
| _personal property first placed in service by an enterprise project_  
| _after January 1, 2015, that is described in Section 1245(a),_  
| _Internal Revenue Code, such as engines, machinery, tools, and_  
| _implements used in a trade or business or held for investment and_  
| _subject to an allowance for depreciation, cost recovery under the_  
| _accelerated cost recovery system, or amortization. The term does_  
| _not include real property or buildings and their structural_  
| _components. Property that is leased under a capitalized lease is_  
| _considered a qualified capital investment, but property that is_  
| _leased under an operating lease is not considered a qualified_  
| _capital investment. Property expensed under Section 179, Internal_  
| _Revenue Code, is not considered a qualified capital investment._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9222._ _____TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY FIRST PLACED IN_  
| _SERVICE BY AN ENTERPRISE PROJECT. For purposes of determining_  
| _whether an investment is a qualified capital investment under_  
| _Section 171.9221, "tangible personal property first placed in_  
| _service by an enterprise project" includes tangible personal_  
| _property:_  
|  _(1)_ _____purchased by an enterprise project for placement_  
| _in an incomplete improvement that is under active construction or_  
| _other physical preparation;_  
|  _(2)_ _____identified by a purchase order, invoice, billing,_  
| _sales slip, or contract; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____physically present at the enterprise project's_  
| _qualified business site, as defined by Section 2303.003, Government_  
| _Code, and in use by the enterprise project on the original due date_  
| _of the report on which the credit is taken._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9223._ _____ELIGIBILITY._ ___An enterprise project that is_  
| _a qualified business is eligible for a credit against the tax_  
| _imposed under this chapter in the amount and under the conditions_  
| _and limitations provided by this subchapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9224._ _____CALCULATION OF CREDIT. (a)_ ___An enterprise_  
| _project that is eligible for a credit under this subchapter may,_  
| _beginning on January 1 of the year in which the project is_  
| _designated or January 1, 2015, establish a credit equal to 7.5_  
| _percent of the qualified capital investment._  
|  _(b)_ _____A taxable entity may file an amended report to claim all_  
| _or part of a credit earned in a previous tax year that has not been_  
| _claimed on another report, subject to Section 171.9225, if the_  
| _applicable period of limitation under Section 111.107 and_  
| _Subchapter D, Chapter 111, for claiming that credit has not_  
| _expired._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9225._ _____LIMITATION. The total credit claimed under_  
| _this subchapter for a report, including the amount of any_  
| _carryforward credit under Section 171.9226, may not exceed 50_  
| _percent of the amount of franchise tax due for the report before any_  
| _other applicable tax credits._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9226._ _____CARRYFORWARD. (a) If an enterprise project_  
| _is eligible for a credit from an installment that exceeds a_  
| _limitation under Section 171.9225, the enterprise project may carry_  
| _the unused credit forward for not more than five consecutive_  
| _reports._  
|  _(b)_ _____A carryforward is considered the remaining portion of an_  
| _installment that cannot be claimed in the current year because of a_  
| _tax limitation under Section 171.9225. A carryforward is added to_  
| _the next year's installment of the credit in determining the tax_  
| _limitation for that year. A credit carryforward from a previous_  
| _report is considered to be used before the current year_  
| _installment._  
|  _Sec._ ___171.9227._ _____CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY. (a) For the_  
| _initial and each succeeding report in which a credit is claimed_

| _sufficiently demonstrates that the enterprise project is eligible_  
| _for the credit._

|  _(5)_ _____the two-digit standard industrial classification_  
| _of enterprise projects claiming a credit under this subchapter;_

| _comptroller shall adopt rules and forms necessary to implement this_  
| _subchapter._  
|  SECTION 2. Except as provided by Section 171.9224(b), Tax  
| Code, as added by this Act, this Act applies only to a report  
| originally due on or after the effective date of this Act.

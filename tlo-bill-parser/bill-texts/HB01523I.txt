| 1, 2020, for the sole purpose of transferring obligations,  
| property, rights, powers, and duties to the Texas Board of  
| Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors as created by this Act.  
| The Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors  
| assumes all of the obligations, property, rights, powers, and  
| duties of the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying as they  
| exist immediately before the effective date of this Act.  All  
| unexpended funds appropriated to the Texas Board of Professional  
| Land Surveying are transferred to the Texas Board of Professional  
| Engineers and Land Surveyors.  
|  (b) The Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land  
| Surveyors and the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying shall,  
| in consultation with appropriate state entities, ensure that the  
| transfer of the obligations, property, rights, powers, and duties  
| of the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying to the Texas Board  
| of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors is completed not later  
| than September 1, 2020.  
|  (c) All rules of the Texas Board of Professional Land  
| Surveying are continued in effect as rules of the Texas Board of  
| Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors until superseded by a  
| rule of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land  
| Surveyors.  A certificate, license, registration, or other  
| authorization issued by the Texas Board of Professional Land  
| Surveying is continued in effect as provided by the law in effect  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act.  An application  
| for a certificate, license, registration, or other authorization  
| pending on the effective date of this Act is continued without  
| change in status after the effective date of this Act.  A complaint,  
| investigation, contested case, or other proceeding pending on the

| after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3.02. The change in law made by this Act to Section  
| 1001.101, Occupations Code, does not affect the entitlement of a  
| member serving on the Texas Board of Professional Engineers  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act to continue to  
| serve for the remainder of the member's term.  As the terms of board  
| members expire, the governor shall appoint or reappoint members to  
| the Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors who  
| have the qualifications required for members under Sections  
| 1001.101 and 1001.102, Occupations Code, as amended by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3.03. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b) of  
| this section, Section 1001.112, Occupations Code, as amended by  
| this Act, applies to a member of the Texas Board of Professional  
| Engineers and Land Surveyors appointed before, on, or after the  
| effective date of this Act.

| effective date of this Act, is required to complete additional  
| training only on the subjects added by this Act to the training  
| program.  A board member described by this subsection may not vote,  
| deliberate, or be counted as a member in attendance at a meeting of

| completes the additional training.  
|  SECTION 3.04. To the extent of any conflict, this Act

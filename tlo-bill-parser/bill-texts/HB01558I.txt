|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the severance tax exemption for oil and gas produced  
| from certain inactive wells.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 202.056(a)(4), Tax Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (4) "Two-year inactive well" means a well that has not  
| produced oil or gas in more than one month in the two years  
| preceding the date of application for severance tax exemption under  
| this section. _The term does not include a well that is:_  
|  _(A)_ _____part of an enhanced oil recovery project, as_  
| _defined by Section 89.002, Natural Resources Code; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____drilled but not completed and that does not_  
| _have a record of hydrocarbon production reported to the commission._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 202.056, Tax Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (i) and adding  
| Subsections (j) and (k) to read as follows:  
|  (b) Hydrocarbons produced from a well qualify for a  
| _five-year_ [ ~~10-year~~ ] severance tax exemption if the commission  
| designates the well as a [ ~~three-year inactive well or a~~ ] two-year  
| inactive well. The commission may require an applicant to provide  
| the commission with any relevant information required to administer  
| this section. The commission may require additional well tests to  
| determine well capability as _the commission_ [ ~~it~~ ] deems necessary.  
| The commission shall notify the comptroller in writing immediately  
| if _the commission_ [ ~~it~~ ] determines that the operation of the  
| [ ~~three-year inactive well or~~ ] two-year inactive well has been  
| terminated or if _the commission_ [ ~~it~~ ] discovers any information that  
| affects the taxation of the production from the designated well.  
|  (c) [ ~~If the commission designates a three-year inactive~~  
|  ~~well under this section, it shall issue a certificate designating~~  
|  ~~the well as a three-year inactive well as defined by Subsection~~  
|  ~~(a)(3) of this section. The commission may not designate a~~  
|  ~~three-year inactive well under this section after February 29,~~  
|  ~~1996.~~ ] If the commission designates a two-year inactive well under  
| this section, _the commission_ [ ~~it~~ ] shall issue a certificate  
| designating the well as a two-year inactive well [ ~~as defined by~~  
|  ~~Subsection (a)(4) of this section. The commission may not~~  
|  ~~designate a two-year inactive well under this section after~~  
|  ~~February 28, 2010~~ ].  
|  (d) [ ~~An application for three-year inactive well~~  
|  ~~certification shall be made during the period of September 1, 1993,~~  
|  ~~through August 31, 1995, to qualify for the tax exemption under this~~  
|  ~~section.~~ ] An application for two-year inactive well certification  
| _must be made to the commission_ [ ~~shall be made during the period~~  
|  ~~September 1, 1997, through August 31, 2009,~~ ] to qualify for the tax  
| exemption under this section. Hydrocarbons sold after the date of  
| certification are eligible for the tax exemption.  
|  (e) The commission may revoke a certificate if information  
| indicates that a certified well was not a [ ~~three-year inactive well~~  
|  ~~or a~~ ] two-year inactive well[ ~~, as appropriate,~~ ] or if other
lease  
| production is credited to the certified well. Upon notice to the  
| operator from the commission that the certificate for tax exemption  
| under this section has been revoked, the tax exemption may not be  
| applied to hydrocarbons sold from that well from the date of  
| revocation.  
|  (h) If the tax is paid at the full rate provided by Section  
| 201.052(a) _or_ [ ~~, 201.052(b),~~ ] 202.052(a)[ ~~, or 202.052(b)~~ ]
before  
| the comptroller approves an application for an exemption provided  
| for in this chapter, the operator is entitled to a credit against  
| taxes imposed by this chapter in an amount equal to the tax paid. To  
| receive a credit, the operator must apply to the comptroller for the  
| credit before the expiration of the applicable period for filing a  
| tax refund claim under Section 111.104.  
|  (i) _A_ [ ~~Penalties~~  
|  [ ~~(1) Any~~] person who makes or subscribes any  
| application, report, or other document and submits _the application,_  
| _report, or other document_ [ ~~it~~ ] to the commission to form the basis  
| for an application for a tax exemption under this section, knowing  
| that the application, report, or other document is false or untrue  
| in a material fact, may be subject to the penalties imposed by  
| Chapters 85 and 91, Natural Resources Code.  
|  _(j) On_ [ ~~(2) Upon~~] notice from the commission that the  
| certification for a [ ~~three-year inactive well or a~~ ] two-year  
| inactive well has been revoked, the tax exemption shall not apply to  
| oil or gas production sold after the date of notification. _A_ [ ~~Any~~ ]  
| person who violates this subsection is liable to the state for a  
| civil penalty if the person applies or attempts to apply the tax  
| exemption allowed by this chapter after the certification for a  
| [ ~~three-year inactive well or a~~ ] two-year inactive well is revoked.  
| The amount of the penalty may not exceed the sum of:  
|  _(1)_ [ ~~(A)~~ ] $10,000; and  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~(B)~~ ] the difference between the amount of taxes  
| paid or attempted to be paid and the amount of taxes due.  
|  _(k)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] The attorney general may recover a penalty under  
| _Subsection (j)_ [ ~~Subdivision (2) of this subsection~~ ] in a suit  
| brought on behalf of the state. Venue for the suit is in Travis  
| County.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 202.056(a)(3), Tax Code, is repealed.  
|  SECTION 4. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an oil or gas well designated by the Railroad Commission of Texas as  
| a two-year inactive well on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An oil or gas well designated by the Railroad Commission of Texas as  
| a two-year inactive well, or as a three-year inactive well, before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect  
| immediately before that date, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

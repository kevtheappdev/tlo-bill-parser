|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to contributions to, benefits from, and the administration  
| of systems and programs administered by the Teacher Retirement  
| System of Texas, including a one-time supplemental payment for  
| retirees.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a)  Section 821.006, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Subsections (c) and (d) to read as follows:  
|  _(c)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), the retirement_  
| _system may provide a one-time supplemental payment to an annuitant_  
| _eligible to receive:_  
|  _(1) a standard retirement annuity payment;_  
|  _(2)_ _____an optional retirement annuity payment as either a_  
| _retiree or beneficiary;_  
|  _(3)_ _____a life annuity payment under Section_  
| _824.402(a)(4);_  
|  _(4)_ _____an annuity for a guaranteed period of 60 months_  
| _under Section 824.402(a)(3); or_  
|  _(5)_ _____an alternate payee annuity payment under Section_  
| _804.005._  
|  _(d)_ _____A one-time supplemental payment under Subsection (c) is_  
| _authorized if the amortization period for the unfunded actuarial_  
| _liabilities of the retirement system does not exceed 30 years by one_  
| _or more years after payment of the supplemental payment._  
|  (b) The Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall make a  
| one-time supplemental payment of a retirement or death benefit, as  
| provided by Section 821.006, Government Code, as amended by this  
| Act, and this section.  
|  (c) The supplemental payment is payable not later than  
| September 2019 and, to the extent practicable, on a date or dates  
| that coincide with the regular annuity payment payable to each  
| eligible annuitant.  
|  (d) The amount of the supplemental payment is equal to the  
| lesser of:  
|  (1) the gross amount of the regular annuity payment to  
| which the eligible annuitant is otherwise entitled for the month of  
| August 2019; or  
|  (2) $2,400.  
|  (e) The supplemental payment is payable without regard to  
| any forfeiture of benefits under Section 824.601, Government Code.  
| The Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall make applicable tax  
| withholding and other legally required deductions before  
| disbursing the supplemental payment. A supplemental payment under  
| this section is in addition to and not in lieu of the regular  
| monthly annuity payment to which the eligible annuitant is  
| otherwise entitled.  
|  (f) Subject to Subsection (g) of this section, to be  
| eligible for the supplemental payment, a person must be, for the  
| month of August 2019, and disregarding any forfeiture of benefits  
| under Section 824.601, Government Code, an annuitant eligible to  
| receive:  
|  (1) a standard retirement annuity payment;  
|  (2) an optional retirement annuity payment as either a  
| retiree or beneficiary;  
|  (3) a life annuity payment under Section  
| 824.402(a)(4), Government Code;  
|  (4) an annuity for a guaranteed period of 60 months  
| under Section 824.402(a)(3), Government Code; or  
|  (5) an alternate payee annuity payment under Section  
| 804.005, Government Code.  
|  (g) If the annuitant is a retiree or a beneficiary under an  
| optional retirement payment plan, to be eligible for the  
| supplemental payment, the effective date of the retirement of the  
| member of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas must have been on  
| or before August 31, 2015. If the annuitant is a beneficiary under  
| Section 824.402(a)(3) or (4), Government Code, to be eligible for  
| the supplemental payment, the date of death of the member of the  
| retirement system must have been on or before August 31, 2015. The  
| supplemental payment shall be made to an alternate payee who is an  
| annuitant under Section 804.005, Government Code, only if the  
| annuity payment to the alternate payee commenced on or before  
| August 31, 2015.  The supplemental payment is in addition to the  
| guaranteed number of payments under Section 824.402(a)(3),  
| 824.204(c)(3) or (4), or 824.308(c)(3) or (4), Government Code, and  
| may not be counted as one of the guaranteed monthly payments.  
|  (h) The supplemental payment does not apply to payments  
| under:  
|  (1) Section 824.304(a), Government Code, relating to  
| disability retirees with less than 10 years of service credit;  
|  (2) Section 824.804(b), Government Code, relating to  
| participants in the deferred retirement option plan with regard to  
| payments from their deferred retirement option plan accounts;  
|  (3) Section 824.501(a), Government Code, relating to  
| retiree survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity in an  
| amount fixed by statute; or  
|  (4) Section 824.404(a), Government Code, relating to  
| active member survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity  
| in an amount fixed by statute.  
|  (i) Except as provided by this section, the board of  
| trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall determine  
| the eligibility for and the amount and timing of a supplemental  
| payment and the manner in which the payment is made.  
|  SECTION 2. (a)  Sections 824.601(b-1) and (f), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b-1) Subsection (b) does not apply to a retiree _:_

| whose benefit payments were suspended under Section 824.601,  
| Government Code, as that section existed before amendment by this  
| Act, is entitled to the resumption of monthly benefit payments if  
| the person meets the requirements of Section 824.601(b-1),  
| Government Code, as amended by this Act.  
|  (c) The Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall resume  
| making monthly benefit payments to a person described by Subsection

|  (d) A person who is entitled to the resumption of monthly  
| benefit payments under this section is not entitled to recover  
| benefit payments not made during the period the person's benefit  
| was suspended under Section 824.601, Government Code, as that  
| section existed before amendment by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. (a)  Section 824.602, Government Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsection (c) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) Subject to _Subsection (c) and_ Section 825.506, the

| retiree is a disability retiree, the employment has not exceeded a  
| total of 90 days in the school year;  
|  (2) in a position, other than as a substitute, on no  
| more than a one-half time basis for the month;  
|  (3) in one or more positions on as much as a full-time

|  (4) in a position, other than as a substitute, on no  
| more than a one-half time basis for no more than 90 days in the

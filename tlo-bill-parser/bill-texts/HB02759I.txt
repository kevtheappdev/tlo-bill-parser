| _the comptroller prepares in accordance with Section 49a(a), Article_  
| _III, Texas Constitution._

| _in which a biennial revenue estimate is submitted to the governor_  
| _and legislature._

| _that would be available for certification for the succeeding_  
| _biennium assuming a franchise tax rate adjustment under this_  
| _section does not take effect in that biennium;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the percentage change between the amount of total_  
| _general revenue-related funds available for certification for the_  
| _current biennium, as provided by the biennial revenue estimate, and_  
| _the amount provided by Subdivision (1) for the succeeding biennium;_  
|  _(3)_ _____if the percentage change under Subdivision (2) is_  
| _greater than five percent, the amount of total general_  
| _revenue-related funds that would be available for certification for_  
| _the succeeding biennium assuming the franchise tax rate adjustment_

| _succeeding biennium._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the percentage change determined under Subsection_  
| _(b)(2) is greater than five percent, the comptroller shall_  
| _determine the amount of revenue available for franchise tax_  
| _reduction, which is computed as follows:_  
| _FTR = 0.5 X (SBGR - (CBGR X 1.05))_  
| _where:_  
|  _"FTR" is the amount of revenue available for franchise tax_  
| _reduction;_  
|  _"SBGR" is the amount provided by Subsection (b)(1) for the_

| _tax in effect when the biennial revenue estimate is submitted to the_  
| _governor and legislature remain in effect for the succeeding_  
| _biennium unless modified by other law._  
|  _(h)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (d), if an adjustment_  
| _otherwise required by that subsection would reduce a rate of the_  
| _franchise tax to less than zero, the rate is instead reduced to_  
| _zero._  
|  _(i)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, if the rates of the_  
| _franchise tax are reduced to zero under Subsection (d) or (h), a_  
| _taxable entity does not owe any tax and is not required to file a_

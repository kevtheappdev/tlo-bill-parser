| _541 and 542._  
|  _(b)_ _____An insurer may not require as a prerequisite to payment_  
| _of benefits under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage a_

| _benefits are paid under the policy._  
|  _(c)_ _____An insurer must attempt in good faith to effectuate a_

| _the insurer of the claim in accordance with Section 1952.1061; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the date on which suit is filed against the insurer_  
| _to recover under the uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage._  
|  _(b)_ _____For the purposes of recovery of attorney's fees under_  
| _Section 38.002, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a claim for_  
| _uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is presented when the_  
| _insurer receives notice of the claim in accordance with Section_  
| _1952.1061._  
|  SECTION 2. (a) Except as provided by this section, the  
| change in law made by this Act applies only to a cause of action that  
| accrues on or after the effective date of this Act. A cause of  
| action that accrues before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect immediately before that date, and that  
| law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  (b) The change in law made by this Act does not affect the  
| enforceability of any provision in an insurance policy delivered,  
| issued for delivery, or renewed before January 1, 2020, that  
| conflicts with the change in law made by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 13.043, Water Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (b-4) to read as follows:  
|  _(b-4)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (b), ratepayers described_  
| _by that subsection may not appeal to the utility commission the_  
| _decision of the governing body of the entity affecting their water,_  
| _drainage, or sewer rates if the decision relates to a rate charged_  
| _to recover the costs associated with the acquisition of a_  
| _nonfunctioning system, as defined by Section 13.4134._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 13.046, Water Code, is transferred to  
| Subchapter K, Chapter 13, Water Code, redesignated as Section

|  Sec. _13.4134_ [ ~~13.046~~ ]. [ ~~TEMPORARY~~ ] RATES FOR SERVICES  
| PROVIDED FOR NONFUNCTIONING SYSTEM; SANCTIONS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.  
| (a) _In this section,_ ___"nonfunctioning system" means a system that is_  
| _operating as a retail public utility and:_  
|  _(1)_ _____does not have a required certificate of_  
| _convenience and necessity;_  
|  _(2)_ _____is under the supervision of the utility commission_  
| _in the manner provided by Section 13.4131; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____is under the supervision of a receiver or_  
| _temporary manager or has been referred for the appointment of a_  
| _temporary manager or receiver in the manner provided by Section_  
| _13.412 or 13.4132._  
|  _(b)_ The utility commission by rule shall establish a  
| procedure that allows a retail public utility that takes over the  
| provision of services for a nonfunctioning _system or acquires a_  
| _nonfunctioning system_ [ ~~retail water or sewer utility service~~  
|  ~~provider~~ ] to charge a reasonable rate for the services provided to  
| the customers of the nonfunctioning system and to bill the  
| customers for the services at that rate immediately to recover  
| [ ~~service~~ ] costs _described by Subsection (c)_.  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(b)~~ ] The rules must provide a streamlined process  
| that the retail public utility that takes over _the provision of_  
| _services for or acquires_ the nonfunctioning system may use to apply  
| to the utility commission for a ruling on the reasonableness of the  
| rates the utility is charging under Subsection _(b)_ [ ~~(a)~~ ]. The  
| process must allow for adequate consideration of costs for  
| interconnection or other costs incurred in making services

| _utility commission shall hold a public meeting to provide_  
| _information on the rate process:_  
|  _(1)_ _____on the request of a member of the legislature who_  
| _represents the area formerly served by the nonfunctioning system;_  
| _or_

| _substantial public interest in the matter._  
|  _(e)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] The utility commission _and the commission_ shall  
| provide a reasonable period for the retail public utility that  
| takes over the nonfunctioning system to bring the nonfunctioning  
| system into compliance with utility commission and commission rules  
| during which the utility commission or the commission may not  
| impose a penalty for any deficiency in the system that is present at  
| the time the utility takes over the nonfunctioning system. The  
| utility commission _and the commission_ must consult with the utility  
| before determining the period and may grant an extension of the  
| period for good cause.  
|  _(f)_ _____During the period described by Subsection (e), the_  
| _retail public utility that provides services for or acquires the_  
| _nonfunctioning system shall report to the utility commission, in_  
| _the manner and frequency specified by the utility commission, the_  
| _retail public utility's progress in bringing the nonfunctioning_  
| _system into compliance with the utility commission's financial,_

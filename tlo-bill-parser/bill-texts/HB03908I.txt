| relating to the allocation of funds remaining in the B-On-Time  
| student loan account following the abolition of that account.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 56.0092, Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) The Texas B-On-time student loan account previously  
| established by former Section 56.463 continues as an account in the  
| general revenue fund.  The account consists of:  
|  (1) gifts and grants;  
|  (2) any legislative appropriations received for the  
| purpose of awarding Texas B-On-time student loans to students who  
| qualify and establish eligibility for the loans as described by  
| Subsection (c) _, for Subsection (e),_ and for discharging any other  
| remaining obligations under the former Texas B-On-time student loan  
| program;  
|  (3) tuition set aside under Section 56.465, as that  
| section existed immediately before September 1, 2015, for a  
| semester or term occurring before the 2015 fall semester;  
|  (4) bond proceeds deposited under Section _52.91_ (a);  
| and  
|  (5) any other money in the account on September 1,  
| 2015.  
|  (b) Money in the Texas B-On-time student loan account may be  
| used ~~only~~ to pay any costs of the coordinating board related to  
| loans awarded under the Texas B-On-time student loan program as  
| provided by Subsection (c) for a semester or term occurring before  
| the 2020 fall semester _or for purposes of Subsection (e)_.  
|  (c) Beginning with the 2015 fall semester, the coordinating  
| board may not award an initial Texas B-On-time student loan under  
| the Texas B-On-time student loan program.  The coordinating board  
| may award, for a semester or term occurring before the 2020 fall  
| semester, a subsequent Texas B-On-time student loan to an eligible  
| student who received an initial Texas B-On-time student loan before  
| the 2015-2016 academic year. For Texas B-On-time student loans to  
| be awarded as described by this subsection:  
|  (1) students may qualify and establish continued  
| eligibility, as applicable, under Subchapter Q as that subchapter  
| existed immediately before September 1, 2015; and  
|  (2) the coordinating board may make loans using any  
| money available for the purposes of the former Texas B-On-time  
| student loan program.  
|  (d) On September 1, 202 _1_ ~~0~~ , the Texas B-On-time student loan  
| account is abolished, and any remaining money in the account may be  
| appropriated only to eligible institutions in the manner provided  
| by Subsection (e).  
|  (e) An appropriation under Subsection (d) must be made in  
| accordance with a _performance-based methodology that allocates_  
| _funding among eligible institutions based on a three-year average_  
| _of the number of bachelor's degrees conferred on at-risk student._  
|  ~~formula, adopted by coordinating board rule, that the coordinating~~  
|  ~~board determines fairly allocates the appropriated amount to those~~  
|  ~~eligible institutions at which the Texas B-On-time student loan~~  
|  ~~program was underutilized. For purposes of this subsection~~  
|  ~~, the~~  
|  ~~Texas B-On-time student loan program is considered to have been~~  
|  ~~underutilized by students of an institution in any period if the~~  
|  ~~institution's percentage of the total amount of tuition set aside~~  
|  ~~by all institutions under the program during the period was greater~~  
|  ~~than the institution's percentage of all students who received a~~  
|  ~~Texas B-On-time student loan under the program for the same period.~~  
|  ~~The coordinating board shall base the coordinating board's~~  
|  ~~determination on a period of academic years occurring before the~~  
|  ~~2015-2016 academic year that the coordinating board considers~~  
|  ~~representative of eligible institutions' student participation in~~  
|  ~~the Texas B-On-time student loan program.~~  
|  (f) In this section, "eligible institution" means a general  
| academic teaching institution described by Section 56.451(2)(A) or  
| a medical and dental unit described by Section 56.451(2)(B), as  
| those paragraphs existed immediately before September 1, 2015.  
|  _(g)_ _____In this section, "at-risk student" means an_  
| _undergraduate student of an institution of higher education:_  
|  _(1)_ _____whose score on the Scholastic Assessment Test_  
| _(SAT) or the American College Test (ACT), excluding the optional_  
| _essay component, is less than the national mean score of students'_  
| _scores on that test; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____who has previously received a grant under the_  
| _federal Pell Grant program or met the Expected Family Contribution_  
| _(EFC) criterion for a grant under that program._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution.  If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

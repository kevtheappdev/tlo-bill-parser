| _participation program under this chapter, the board may require a_  
| _mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each_  
| _paying provider located in the district. The board may provide for_  
| _the mandatory payment to be assessed incrementally throughout the_  
| _year; provided, however, that paying providers shall have thirty_  
| _(30) calendar days upon receipt of written notice from the district_  
| _to make any mandatory payment. In the first year in which the_  
| _mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on_  
| _the net patient revenue of a paying provider as determined by the_  
| _paying provider's copy of its Medicare cost report for the previous_  
| _fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for which the_  
| _paying provider submitted the Medicare cost report._  
|  _(b)_ _The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this_  
| _chapter must be uniformly proportionate with the amount of net_  
| _patient revenue generated by each paying provider in the district_  
| _as permitted under federal law. A health care provider_  
| _participation program authorized under this chapter may not hold_  
| _harmless any institutional health care provider, as required under_  
| _42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w)._  
|  _(c)_ _If the board requires a mandatory payment authorized_  
| _under this chapter, the board shall set the amount of the mandatory_  
| _payment, subject to the limitations of this chapter._ ___The aggregate_  
| _amount of the mandatory payments required of all paying providers_  
| _in the district may not exceed four percent of the aggregate net_  
| _patient revenue from hospital services provided by all paying_  
| _providers in the district._  
|  _(d)_ _Subject to Subsection (c), if the board requires a_  
| _mandatory payment authorized under this chapter, the board shall_  
| _set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will_  
| _generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of_  
| _the district for activities under this chapter and to fund an_  
| _intergovernmental transfer described by Section .103(c)(1). Of the_  
| _annual amount of revenue received by the district attributable to_  
| _mandatory payments authorized under this chapter, 0.25% shall be_  
| _paid to the district for administrative expenses._  
|  _(e)_ _A paying provider may not add a mandatory payment_  
| _required under this section as a surcharge to a patient._  
|  _(f)_ _A mandatory payment assessed under this chapter is not a_  
| _tax for hospital purposes for purposes of Section 4, Article IX,_

| _or contract with another person to assess and collect the mandatory_  
| _payments authorized under this chapter._  
|  _(b)_ _The person charged by the district with the assessment_  
| _and collection of mandatory payments shall charge and deduct from_  
| _the mandatory payments collected for the district a collection fee_  
| _in an amount not to exceed the person's usual and customary charges_  
| _for like services._  
|  _(c)_ _If the person charged with the assessment and collection_  
| _of mandatory payments is an official of the district, any revenue_  
| _from a collection fee charged under Subsection (b) shall be_  
| _deposited in the district general fund and, if appropriate, shall_  
| _be reported as fees of the district._  
|  _Sec._ ___299.153_ _____PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR_  
| _PROCEDURE; LIMITATION OF AUTHORITY._  
|  _(a)_ _The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the district_  
| _to establish a program to enable the district to collect mandatory_  
| _payments from institutional health care providers to fund the_  
| _nonfederal share of a Medicaid supplemental payment program or the_  
| _Medicaid managed care rate enhancements for nonpublic hospitals to_  
| _support the provision of health care by institutional health care_  
| _providers to district residents in need of health care._  
|  _(b)_ _This chapter does not authorize the district to collect_  
| _mandatory payments for the purpose of raising general revenue or_  
| _any amount in excess of the amount reasonably necessary to fund the_  
| _uses described in Section 299.103(c) to cover the administrative_  
| _expenses of the district associated with activities under this_  
| _chapter._  
|  _(c)_ _To the extent any provision or procedure under this_  
| _chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to_  
| _be ineligible for federal matching funds, the board may provide by_  
| _rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the_  
| _requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid_  
| _Services. A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose,_  
| _or materially expand the legal or financial liability or_  
| _responsibility of the district or an institutional health care_  
| _provider in the district beyond the provisions of this chapter._  
| _This section does not require the board to adopt a rule._  
|  _(d)_ _The district may only assess and collect a mandatory_  
| _payment authorized under this chapter if a waiver program, uniform_  
| _rate enhancement, or reimbursement described by Section_  
| _299.103(c)(1) is available to the district._  
|  SECTION 2. If before implementing any provision of this Act  
| a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

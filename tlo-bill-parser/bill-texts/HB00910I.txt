|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to abolishing the regulation of auctioneers.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Articles 18.19(c), (d), and (e), Code of  
| Criminal Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) If there is no prosecution or conviction for an offense  
| involving the weapon seized, the magistrate to whom the seizure was  
| reported shall, before the 61st day after the date the magistrate  
| determines that there will be no prosecution or conviction, notify  
| in writing the person found in possession of the weapon that the  
| person is entitled to the weapon upon written request to the  
| magistrate. The magistrate shall order the weapon returned to the  
| person found in possession before the 61st day after the date the  
| magistrate receives a request from the person. If the weapon is not  
| requested before the 61st day after the date of notification, the  
| magistrate shall, before the 121st day after the date of  
| notification, order the weapon destroyed, sold at public sale by  
| the law enforcement agency holding the weapon or by an auctioneer  
| [ ~~licensed under Chapter 1802, Occupations Code~~ ], or forfeited to  
| the state for use by the law enforcement agency holding the weapon  
| or by a county forensic laboratory designated by the magistrate. If  
| the magistrate does not order the return, destruction, sale, or  
| forfeiture of the weapon within the applicable period prescribed by  
| this subsection, the law enforcement agency holding the weapon may  
| request an order of destruction, sale, or forfeiture of the weapon  
| from the magistrate. Only a firearms dealer licensed under 18  
| U.S.C. Section 923 may purchase a weapon at public sale under this  
| subsection. Proceeds from the sale of a seized weapon under this  
| subsection shall be transferred, after the deduction of court costs  
| to which a district court clerk is entitled under Article 59.05(f),  
| followed by the deduction of auction costs, to the law enforcement  
| agency holding the weapon.  
|  (d) A person either convicted or receiving deferred  
| adjudication under Chapter 46, Penal Code, is entitled to the  
| weapon seized upon request to the court in which the person was  
| convicted or placed on deferred adjudication. However, the court  
| entering the judgment shall order the weapon destroyed, sold at  
| public sale by the law enforcement agency holding the weapon or by  
| an auctioneer [ ~~licensed under Chapter 1802, Occupations Code~~ ], or  
| forfeited to the state for use by the law enforcement agency holding  
| the weapon or by a county forensic laboratory designated by the  
| court if:  
|  (1) the person does not request the weapon before the  
| 61st day after the date of the judgment of conviction or the order  
| placing the person on deferred adjudication;  
|  (2) the person has been previously convicted under  
| Chapter 46, Penal Code;  
|  (3) the weapon is one defined as a prohibited weapon  
| under Chapter 46, Penal Code;  
|  (4) the offense for which the person is convicted or  
| receives deferred adjudication was committed in or on the premises  
| of a playground, school, video arcade facility, or youth center, as  
| those terms are defined by Section 481.134, Health and Safety Code;  
| or  
|  (5) the court determines based on the prior criminal  
| history of the defendant or based on the circumstances surrounding  
| the commission of the offense that possession of the seized weapon  
| would pose a threat to the community or one or more individuals.  
|  (e) If the person found in possession of a weapon is  
| convicted of an offense involving the use of the weapon, before the  
| 61st day after the date of conviction the court entering judgment of  
| conviction shall order destruction of the weapon, sale at public  
| sale by the law enforcement agency holding the weapon or by an  
| auctioneer [ ~~licensed under Chapter 1802, Occupations Code~~ ], or  
| forfeiture to the state for use by the law enforcement agency  
| holding the weapon or by a county forensic laboratory designated by  
| the court. If the court entering judgment of conviction does not  
| order the destruction, sale, or forfeiture of the weapon within the  
| period prescribed by this subsection, the law enforcement agency  
| holding the weapon may request an order of destruction, sale, or  
| forfeiture of the weapon from a magistrate. Only a firearms dealer  
| licensed under 18 U.S.C. Section 923 may purchase a weapon at public  
| sale under this subsection. Proceeds from the sale of a seized  
| weapon under this subsection shall be transferred, after the  
| deduction of court costs to which a district court clerk is entitled  
| under Article 59.05(f), followed by the deduction of auction costs,  
| to the law enforcement agency holding the weapon.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 263.153(c), Local Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) A county that contracts with an auctioneer [ ~~licensed~~  
|  ~~under Chapter 1802, Occupations Code,~~ ] who uses an Internet auction  
| site offering online bidding through the Internet to sell surplus  
| or salvage property under this subchapter having an estimated value  
| of not more than $500 shall satisfy the notice requirement under  
| this section by posting the property on the site for at least 10  
| days unless the property is sold before the 10th day.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 1101.005, Occupations Code, is amended

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to rate filings by the Texas Windstorm Insurance  
| Association.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 2210.351(d), Insurance Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (d) The association may use a rate filed by the association  
| without prior commissioner approval if:  
|  (1) the filing is made not later than the 30th day  
| before the date of any use or delivery for use of the rate;  
|  (2) the filed rate does not exceed _101_ [ ~~105~~ ] percent of  
| the rate in effect on the date on which the filing is made;  
|  (3) the filed rate does not reflect a rate change for  
| an individual rating class that is _more than one_ [ ~~10~~ ] percent higher  
| than the rate in effect for that rating class on the date on which  
| the filing is made; and  
|  (4) the commissioner has not disapproved the filing in  
| writing, advising of the reasons for the disapproval and the  
| criteria the association is required to meet to obtain approval.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2210.352(a-1), Insurance Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a-1) The association may use a rate filed by the  
| association under this section without prior commissioner approval  
| if:  
|  (1) the filing is made not later than the 30th day  
| before the date of any use or delivery for use of the rate;  
|  (2) the filed rate does not exceed _101_ [ ~~105~~ ] percent of  
| the rate used by the association in effect on the date on which the  
| filing is made; and  
|  (3) the filed rate does not reflect a rate change for  
| an individual rating class that is _more than one_ [ ~~10~~ ] percent higher  
| than the rate in effect for that rating class on the date on which  
| the filing is made.  
|  SECTION 3. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a rate filed by the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association with  
| the Texas Department of Insurance on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A rate filed with the Texas Department of Insurance  
| before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law as it  
| existed immediately before that date, and that law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect December 1, 2019.

|  AN ACT  
| relating to postconviction forensic DNA testing.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 64.03, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by adding Subsection (a-1) and amending Subsection (c) to  
| read as follows:  
|  _(a-1)_ _____In this article, the term "exculpatory results"_  
| _includes DNA test results that indicate a match, pursuant to a_  
| _comparison procedure conducted by a laboratory described by_  
| _Subsection (c), between an unidentified DNA profile on the evidence_  
| _tested and another individual's DNA profile contained in a DNA_  
| _database described by Article 64.035 or otherwise in the possession_  
| _of a law enforcement agency._  
|  (c) If the convicting court finds in the affirmative the  
| issues listed in Subsection (a)(1) and the convicted person meets  
| the requirements of Subsection (a)(2), the court shall order that  
| the requested forensic DNA testing be conducted. The court may  
| order the test to be conducted by:

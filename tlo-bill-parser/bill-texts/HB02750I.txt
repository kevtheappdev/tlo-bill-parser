|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the selection of the board of directors of an appraisal  
| district; authorizing the imposition of a fee.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 6.03, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a), (b), (c), (k), and (l) and adding Subsections  
| (a-1), (a-2), and (m) to read as follows:  
|  (a) The appraisal district is governed by a board of _five_  
| directors. _One director is elected at the general election for_  
| _state and county officers by the voters of the county in which the_  
| _district is established, and four_ [ ~~Five~~ ] directors are appointed by  
| the taxing units that participate in the district as provided by  
| this section.  
|  _(a-1)_ If the county assessor-collector is not appointed to  
| the board _of directors_ , the county assessor-collector serves as a  
| nonvoting director. The county assessor-collector is ineligible to  
| serve if the board enters into a contract under Section 6.05(b) or  
| if the commissioners court of the county enters into a contract  
| under Section 6.24(b).  
|  _(a-2)_ To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an  
| individual _,_ other than a county assessor-collector serving as a  
| nonvoting director _,_ must be a resident of the _appraisal_ district  
| and must have resided in the district for at least two years  
| immediately preceding the date the individual takes office. _To be_  
| _eligible to be elected to the board, an individual must be a_  
| _resident of the county in which the district is established._ An  
| individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board _as a_  
| _member appointed by the taxing units participating in the district_  
| is not ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a  
| taxing unit. An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the  
| district is not eligible to serve on the board _as a member appointed_  
| _by the taxing units participating in the district_ unless the  
| individual is also a member of the governing body or an elected  
| official of a taxing unit that participates in the district.  
|  (b) Members of the board of directors _,_ other than a county  
| assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director _,_ serve two-year  
| terms _. The terms of directors elected at a general election begin_  
| _on January 1 of odd-numbered years. The terms of directors_  
| _appointed by the taxing units begin_ [ ~~beginning~~ ] on January 1 of  
| even-numbered years.  
|  (c) Members of the board of directors _,_ other than a county  
| assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director _and other than_  
| _the elected members,_ are appointed by vote of the governing bodies  
| of the incorporated cities and towns, the school districts, the  
| junior college districts, and, if entitled to vote, the  
| conservation and reclamation districts that participate in the  
| district and of the county. A governing body may cast all its votes  
| for one candidate or distribute them among candidates for any  
| number of directorships. Conservation and reclamation districts  
| are not entitled to vote unless at least one conservation and  
| reclamation district in the district delivers to the chief  
| appraiser a written request to nominate and vote on the board of  
| directors by June 1 of each odd-numbered year. On receipt of a  
| request, the chief appraiser shall certify a list by June 15 of all  
| eligible conservation and reclamation districts that are imposing  
| taxes and that participate in the district.  
|  (k) The governing body of each taxing unit entitled to vote  
| shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief  
| appraiser before December 15. The chief appraiser shall count the  
| votes, declare the _four_ [ ~~five~~ ] candidates who receive the largest  
| cumulative vote totals _appointed_ [ ~~elected~~ ], and submit the results  
| before December 31 to the governing body of each taxing unit in the  
| district and to the candidates. For purposes of determining the  
| number of votes received by the candidates, the candidate receiving  
| the most votes of the conservation and reclamation districts is  
| considered to have received all of the votes cast by conservation  
| and reclamation districts and the other candidates are considered  
| not to have received any votes of the conservation and reclamation  
| districts. The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any  
| method of chance.  
|  (l) If a vacancy occurs _in an appointive position_ on the  
| board of directors _,_ other than a vacancy in the position held by a  
| county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director, each  
| taxing unit that is entitled to vote by this section may nominate by  
| resolution adopted by its governing body a candidate to fill the  
| vacancy. The _taxing_ unit shall submit the name of its nominee to  
| the chief appraiser within 45 days after notification from the  
| board of directors of the existence of the vacancy, and the chief  
| appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the board of directors  
| within the next five days a list of the nominees. The board of  
| directors shall _appoint_ [ ~~elect~~ ] by majority vote of its members one  
| of the nominees to fill the vacancy.  
|  _(m)_ _____If a vacancy occurs in an elective position on the board_  
| _of directors, the board of directors shall appoint by majority vote_  
| _of its members a person to fill the vacancy. A person appointed to_  
| _fill a vacancy in an elective position must have the qualifications_  
| _required of a director elected at a general election._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 6.031, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 6.031. CHANGES IN BOARD MEMBERSHIP [ ~~OR SELECTION~~ ].  
| (a) The board of directors of an appraisal district, by resolution  
| adopted and delivered to each taxing unit participating in the  
| district before _May_ [ ~~August~~ ] 15, may increase the number of members  
| on the board of directors of the district to not more than 13,  
| change the method or procedure for appointing the members _appointed_  
| _by the taxing units participating in the district_ , or both, unless  
| the governing body of a taxing unit that is entitled to vote on the  
| appointment of board members adopts a resolution opposing the  
| change _in the method or procedure for appointing those members_ [ ~~,~~ ]  
| and files it with the board of directors before _June_ [ ~~September~~ ] 1.  
| If a change _in the method or procedure for appointing those members_  
| is rejected, the board shall notify, in writing, each taxing unit  
| participating in the district before _June_ [ ~~September~~ ] 15.  
|  (b) The taxing units participating in an appraisal district  
| may increase the number of members on the board of directors of the  
| district to not more than 13, change the method or procedure for  
| appointing the members _appointed by the taxing units participating_  
| _in the district_ , or both, if the governing bodies of three-fourths  
| of the taxing units that are entitled to vote on the appointment of  
| board members adopt resolutions providing for the change. However,  
| a change under this subsection _in the method or procedure for_  
| _selecting members appointed by the taxing units participating in_  
| _the district_ is not valid if it reduces the voting entitlement of  
| one or more taxing units that do not adopt a resolution proposing it  
| to less than a majority of the voting entitlement under Section 6.03  
| [ ~~of this code~~ ] or if it reduces the voting entitlement of any taxing  
| unit that does not adopt a resolution proposing it to less than 50  
| percent of its voting entitlement under Section 6.03 [ ~~of this code~~ ]  
| and if that taxing unit's allocation of the budget is not reduced to  
| the same proportional percentage amount, or if it expands the types  
| of taxing units that are entitled to vote on appointment of board  
| members.  
|  (b-1) If an appraisal district increases the number of  
| members on the board of directors of the district or changes the  
| method or procedure for appointing the members _appointed by the_  
| _taxing units participating in the district_ as provided by this  
| section, the board of directors by resolution shall provide for the  
| junior college districts that participate in the appraisal district  
| to collectively participate in the selection of _those_ directors in  
| the same manner as the school district that imposes the lowest total  
| dollar amount of property taxes in the appraisal district among all  
| of the school districts with representation in the appraisal  
| district. A resolution adopted under this section is not subject  
| to rejection by a resolution opposing the change filed with the  
| board of directors by a taxing unit under Subsection (a).  
|  (c) An official copy of a resolution under _Subsection (b)_  
| [ ~~this section~~ ] must be filed with the chief appraiser of the  
| appraisal district after _May_ [ ~~June~~ ] 30 and before _August_ [
~~October~~ ]  
| 1 [ ~~of a year in which board members are appointed~~ ] or the resolution  
| is ineffective.  
|  (d) Before _August 15_ [ ~~October 5 of each year in which board~~  
|  ~~members are appointed~~ ], the chief appraiser shall determine whether  
| a sufficient number of eligible taxing units have filed valid  
| resolutions proposing a change _under Subsection (b)_ for the change  
| to take effect. The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit  
| participating in the district of each change that is adopted before  
| _August 30_ [ ~~October 10~~ ].  _A change in the method or procedure for_  
| _selecting members appointed by the taxing units participating in_  
| _the district that is adopted takes effect on the date the chief_  
| _appraiser notifies the taxing units of the change. An increase in_  
| _the number of members of the board takes effect on January 1 of the_  
| _first year after the date the chief appraiser notifies the taxing_  
| _units of the increase._  
|  (e) _If the number of members of the board is increased under_  
| _this section, one-half of the total number of positions on the board_  
| _must be elective positions filled in the manner provided by Section_  
| _6.03._  
|  _(f)_ A change in [ ~~membership or~~ ] selection _of the board_  
| _members appointed by the taxing units participating in the district_  
| made as provided by this section remains in effect until changed in  
| a manner provided by this section or rescinded by resolution of a  
| majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on  
| appointment of board members under Section 6.03 [ ~~of this code~~ ].  
|  _(g)_ [ ~~(f)~~ ] A provision of Section 6.03 [ ~~of this code~~ ] that is  
| subject to change under this section but is not expressly changed by  
| resolution of a sufficient number of eligible taxing units remains  
| in effect.  
|  _(h)_ [ ~~(g)~~ ] For purposes of this section, the conservation  
| and reclamation districts in an appraisal district are considered  
| to be entitled to vote on the appointment of appraisal district  
| directors if:  
|  (1) a conservation and reclamation district has filed  
| a request to the chief appraiser to nominate and vote on directors  
| in the current year as provided by Section 6.03(c); or  
|  (2) conservation and reclamation districts were  
| entitled to vote on the appointment of directors in the appraisal  
| district in the most recent year in which directors were appointed  
| under Section 6.03.  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter A, Chapter 6, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 6.032 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___6.032._ _____BALLOT PROCEDURES FOR ELECTED DIRECTORS; FILING_  
| _FEE._ ___(a)_ ___Except as provided by this section, Chapter 144, Election_  
| _Code, applies to a candidate for an elective position on an_  
| _appraisal district board of directors._  
|  _(b)_ _____An application for a place on the ballot must be filed_  
| _with the county judge of the county for which the appraisal district_  
| _is established and be accompanied by a filing fee of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____$1,250 for a county with a population of 200,000 or_  
| _more; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____$750 for a county with a population of less than_  
| _200,000._  
|  _(c)_ _____A filing fee received under this section shall be_  
| _deposited in the county treasury to the credit of the county general_  
| _fund._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 6.033, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 6.033. RECALL OF _APPOINTED_ DIRECTOR.  (a) The  
| governing body of a taxing unit may call for the recall of a member  
| of the board of directors of an appraisal district appointed _by the_  
| _taxing units participating in the district_ under Section 6.03 [ ~~of~~  
|  ~~this code~~ ] for whom the _taxing_ unit cast any of its votes in the  
| appointment of the _appointive_ board _members_. The call must be in  
| the form of a resolution, be filed with the chief appraiser of the  
| appraisal district, and state that the _taxing_ unit is calling for  
| the recall of the member. If a resolution calling for the recall of  
| a board member is filed under this subsection, the chief appraiser,  
| not later than the 10th day after the date of filing, shall deliver  
| a written notice of the filing of the resolution and the date of its  
| filing to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing  
| unit entitled to vote in the appointment of board members.  
|  (b) On or before the 30th day after the date on which a  
| resolution calling for the recall of a member of the board _appointed_  
| _by the taxing units participating in the district_ is filed, the  
| governing body of a taxing unit that cast any of its votes in the  
| appointment of the board for that member may vote to recall the  
| member by resolution submitted to the chief appraiser.  Each taxing  
| unit is entitled to the same number of votes in the recall as it cast  
| for that member in the _member's_ appointment _to_ [ ~~of~~ ] the board. The  
| governing body of the taxing unit calling for the recall may cast  
| its votes in favor of the recall in the same resolution in which it  
| called for the recall.  
|  (c) Not later than the 10th day after the last day provided  
| by this section for voting in favor of the recall, the chief  
| appraiser shall count the votes cast in favor of the recall. If the  
| number of votes in favor of the recall equals or exceeds a majority  
| of the votes cast for the member in the _member's_ appointment _to_ [ ~~of~~
]  
| the board, the member is recalled and ceases to be a member of the  
| board. The chief appraiser shall immediately notify in writing the  
| presiding officer of the appraisal district board of directors and  
| of the governing body of each taxing unit that voted in the recall  
| election of the outcome of the recall election. If the presiding  
| officer of the appraisal district board of directors is the member  
| whose recall was voted on, the chief appraiser shall also notify the  
| secretary of the appraisal district board of directors of the  
| outcome of the recall election.  
|  (d) If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors after the  
| recall of a member of the board under this section, the taxing units  
| that were entitled to vote in the recall election shall appoint a  
| new board member _to the vacancy_. Each taxing unit is entitled to  
| the same number of votes as it originally cast to appoint the  
| recalled board member. Each taxing unit entitled to vote may  
| nominate one candidate by resolution adopted by its governing body.  
| The presiding officer of the governing body of the _taxing_ unit shall  
| submit the name of the _taxing_ unit's nominee to the chief appraiser  
| on or before the 30th day after the date it receives notification  
| from the chief appraiser of the result of the recall election. On or  
| before the 15th day after the last day provided for a nomination to  
| be submitted, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing  
| the candidates nominated alphabetically according to each  
| candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the  
| presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is  
| entitled to vote. On or before the 15th day after the date on which  
| a taxing unit's ballot is delivered, the governing body of the  
| taxing unit shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to  
| the chief appraiser.  On or before the 15th day after the last day on  
| which a taxing unit may vote, the chief appraiser shall count the  
| votes, declare the candidate who received the largest vote total  
| appointed, and submit the results to the presiding officer of the  
| governing body of the appraisal district and of each taxing unit in  
| the district and to the candidates. The chief appraiser shall  
| resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.  
|  (e) If the _members appointed by the taxing units_  
| _participating in the district to the_ board of directors of an  
| appraisal district _are_ [ ~~is~~ ] appointed by a method or procedure  
| adopted under Section 6.031 [ ~~of this code~~ ], the governing bodies of  
| the taxing units that voted for or otherwise participated in the  
| appointment of a member of the board may recall that member and  
| appoint a new member to the vacancy by any method adopted by  
| resolution of a majority of those governing bodies. If the  
| appointment was by election _by the taxing units participating in_  
| _the district_ , the method of recall and of appointing a new member to  
| the vacancy is not valid unless it provides that each taxing unit is  
| entitled to the same number of votes in the recall and in the  
| appointment to fill the vacancy as _the taxing unit_ [ ~~it~~ ] originally  
| cast for the member being recalled.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 6.036(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) An individual is not eligible to be _a candidate for, to_  
| _be_ appointed to _,_ or to serve on the board of directors of an  
| appraisal district if the individual or a business entity in which  
| the individual has a substantial interest is a party to a contract  
| with:  
|  (1) the appraisal district; or  
|  (2) a taxing unit that participates in the appraisal  
| district, if the contract relates to the performance of an activity  
| governed by this title.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 6.037, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 6.037. PARTICIPATION OF CONSERVATION AND RECLAMATION  
| DISTRICTS IN APPRAISAL DISTRICT MATTERS. In this title, a  
| reference to the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of  
| appraisal district board members includes the conservation and  
| reclamation districts participating in the appraisal district,  
| without regard to whether the conservation and reclamation  
| districts are currently entitled to do so under Section 6.03(c). In  
| a provision of this title other than Section 6.03 or 6.031 that  
| grants authority to a majority or other number of the taxing units  
| entitled to vote on the appointment of appraisal district  
| directors, including the disapproval of the appraisal district  
| budget under Section 6.06 [ ~~and the disapproval of appraisal~~  
|  ~~district board actions under Section 6.10~~ ], the conservation and  
| reclamation districts participating in the appraisal district are  
| given the vote or authority of one taxing unit. That vote or  
| authority is considered exercised only if a majority of the  
| conservation and reclamation districts take the same action to  
| exercise that vote or authority. Otherwise, the conservation and  
| reclamation districts are treated in the same manner as a single  
| taxing unit that is entitled to act but does not take any action on  
| the matter.  
|  SECTION 7. Sections 6.034 and 6.10, Tax Code, are repealed.  
|  SECTION 8. (a)  The appraisal district director holding an  
| elective position shall be elected in each appraisal district as  
| provided by Section 6.03, Tax Code, as amended by this Act, and  
| Section 6.032, Tax Code, as added by this Act, beginning with the  
| general election for state and county officers conducted in 2020.  
| The director then elected takes office January 1, 2021.  
|  (b) The change in law made by this Act does not affect the  
| selection of appraisal district directors serving before January 1,  
| 2021.  
|  (c) The term of an appraisal district director serving on  
| December 31, 2020, expires on January 1, 2021. Notwithstanding  
| Section 6.03(b), Tax Code, as amended by this Act, the taxing units  
| participating in the appraisal district shall appoint the  
| appropriate number of appraisal district directors to serve a  
| one-year term beginning January 1, 2021. Thereafter, directors  
| serving in appointive positions on the board serve two-year terms  
| beginning January 1 of each even-numbered year.  
|  SECTION 9. (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this  
| section, this Act takes effect January 1, 2021.  
|  (b) This section and Section 8 of this Act take effect  
| September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a requirement that the Railroad Commission of Texas  
| require the installation and use of subsurface safety valves on oil  
| and gas wells drilled in certain areas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter D, Chapter 91, Natural Resources  
| Code, is amended by adding Section 91.1016 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___91.1016._ _____SUBSURFACE SAFETY VALVES IN CERTAIN AREAS._  
| _(a) To prevent spills or releases of oil, gas, and related_  
| _hydrocarbons, the commission by rule shall require the installation_  
| _and use of subsurface safety valves in oil and gas wells drilled in:_  
|  _(1) bays and estuaries;_  
|  _(2)_ _____flood zones, particularly areas adjacent to rivers_  
| _or other bodies of water; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____areas subject to hurricanes or other catastrophic_  
| _events._  
|  _(b)_ _____To determine whether a subsurface safety valve_  
| _installed in an oil or gas well is working properly, the commission_  
| _may inspect the valve or require the operator of the well to submit_  
| _to the commission information about the valve._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an oil or gas well for which the application for the drilling  
| permit is submitted to the Railroad Commission of Texas on or after  
| the effective date of the rules adopted under Section 91.1016,  
| Natural Resources Code, as added by this Act. A well for which the  
| application for the drilling permit is submitted before the date  
| the rules take effect is governed by the law in effect when the  
| application is submitted, and that law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

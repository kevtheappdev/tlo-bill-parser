| _files in the possession of the attorney representing the state in_  
| _the person's case. A purported waiver of that right that is_  
| _executed in violation of this subsection is void._

| _the person has signed a waiver authorized under Article 55.01(e)._  
|  (b) Unless the person who is the subject of the expunction  
| order is again arrested for or charged with an offense arising out  
| of the transaction for which the person was arrested or unless the  
| court provides for the retention of records and files under  
| Subsection (a-1) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (a-2), _or (a-3),_ the provisions of

| a waiver of a person's right to an expunction or an order of

| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the  
| date the waiver was made, and the former law is continued in effect  
| for that purpose.

| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to appropriations of water for use in aquifer storage and  
| recovery projects.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.153, Water Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (b) and adding Subsections (d), (e), and (f) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) A water right holder or a person who has contracted for  
| the use of water under a contract that does not prohibit the use of  
| the water in an aquifer storage and recovery project may undertake  
| an aquifer storage and recovery project _and subsequently retrieve_  
| _and use the water under the existing water right_ without obtaining  
| any additional authorization under this chapter for the project.  A  
| person described by this subsection undertaking an aquifer storage  
| and recovery project must:  
|  (1) obtain any required authorizations under  
| Subchapter G, Chapter 27, and Subchapter N, Chapter 36; and  
|  (2) comply with the terms of the applicable water  
| right.  
|  _(d)_ _____An aquifer storage and recovery project may involve the_  
| _use of water derived from multiple sources, including a new_  
| _appropriation of water. Except as provided by Subsection (e), a_  
| _water right or an amendment to a water right authorizing a new_  
| _appropriation of water for use in an aquifer storage and recovery_  
| _project:_  
|  _(1)_ _____must comply with the requirements of Section_  
| _11.134;_  
|  _(2)_ _____must include any special conditions the commission_  
| _considers necessary to implement this section;_  
|  _(3)_ _____may be for water that is not continuously_  
| _available; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____may authorize the diversion and use of_  
| _unappropriated flows in a watercourse or stream that would_  
| _otherwise flow into the Gulf of Mexico._  
|  _(e)_ _____Before approving an application for a water right or an_  
| _amendment to a water right for a new appropriation of water in the_  
| _Rio Grande basin for an aquifer storage and recovery project, the_  
| _commission shall consider the water accounting requirements for any_  
| _international water sharing treaty, minutes, and agreement_  
| _applicable to the Rio Grande basin and the effect of the project on_  
| _the allocation of water by the Rio Grande watermaster in the middle_  
| _and lower Rio Grande. The commission may not authorize a new_  
| _appropriation of water that would result in a violation of a treaty_  
| _or court decision._  
|  _(f) The commission shall adopt rules providing for:_  
|  _(1)_ _____an expedited procedure for acting on an_  
| _application for a water right or an amendment to a water right under_  
| _this section;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the considerations for determining the frequency_  
| _that the water must be available before it may be appropriated; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the method to apply environmental flow standards_  
| _for infrequently available water._  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter D, Chapter 11, Water Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 11.156 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___11.156._ _____AMENDMENT TO CONVERT USE FROM RESERVOIR_  
| _STORAGE TO AQUIFER STORAGE AND RECOVERY._ ___(a)_ ___In this section,_  
| _"aquifer storage and recovery project" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 27.151._  
|  _(b)_ _____A holder of a water right authorizing an appropriation_  
| _of water for storage in a storage reservoir that has not been_  
| _constructed or that has lost storage because of sedimentation, as_  
| _determined by a survey performed or accepted by the board, may file_  
| _an application for an amendment to the water right to change the use_  
| _or purpose for which the appropriation is to be made to storage in_  
| _an aquifer as part of an aquifer storage and recovery project for_  
| _later retrieval and use as authorized by the original water right._  
|  _(c)_ _____An application for an amendment to a water right_  
| _described by Subsection (b) may request an increase in the amount of_  
| _water that may be diverted or the rate of diversion on the basis of_  
| _an evaporation credit that takes into account the amount of water_  
| _that would have evaporated if the storage reservoir had been_  
| _constructed._  
|  _(d)_ _____An application for an amendment to a water right_  
| _described by Subsection (b):_  
|  _(1)_ _____is exempt from any notice and hearing requirements_  
| _of a statute, commission rule, or permit condition and may not be_  
| _referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings for a_  
| _contested case hearing if the application does not request:_  
|  _(A)_ _____an increase in the amount of water that may be_  
| _diverted, the rate of diversion, or the amount of total storage; or_  
|  _(B) a change in the diversion point; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____is subject to the notice and hearing requirements_  
| _of this chapter if the application requests:_  
|  _(A)_ _____an increase in the amount of water that may be_  
| _diverted or the rate of diversion, including an increase on the_  
| _basis of an evaporation credit; or_  
|  _(B) a change in the diversion point._  
|  _(e)_ _____If the commission grants an application for an amendment_  
| _to a water right described by Subsection (d)(2), the commission_  
| _shall include in the amendment any special conditions the_  
| _commission considers necessary to:_  
|  _(1) protect existing water rights; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____comply with any applicable environmental flow_  
| _standards established under Section 11.1471 if the change results_  
| _in a negative effect on the environment._  
|  _(f)_ _____The commission may adopt rules providing an expedited_  
| _procedure for acting on an application for an amendment to a water_  
| _right described by Subsection (b)._  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

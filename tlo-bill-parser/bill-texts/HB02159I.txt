|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the correction of an ad valorem tax appraisal roll.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 25.25(d), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (d) At any time prior to the date the taxes become  
| delinquent, a property owner or the chief appraiser may file a  
| motion with the appraisal review board to change the appraisal roll  
| to correct an error _, including an error regarding the unequal_  
| _appraisal or excessive market value of a property,_ that resulted in  
| an incorrect appraised value for the owner's property.  However,  
| the error may not be corrected unless it resulted in an appraised  
| value that exceeds by more than one-third the correct appraised  
| value.  If the appraisal roll is changed under this subsection, the  
| property owner must pay to each affected taxing unit a  
| late-correction penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of taxes  
| as calculated on the basis of the corrected appraised value.  
| Payment of the late-correction penalty is secured by the lien that  
| attaches to the property under Section 32.01 and is subject to  
| enforced collection under Chapter 33.  The roll may not be changed  
| under this subsection if:  
|  (1) the property was the subject of a protest brought  
| by the property owner under Chapter 41, a hearing on the protest was  
| conducted in which the property owner offered evidence or argument,  
| and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest  
| on the merits; or  
|  (2) the appraised value of the property was  
| established as a result of a written agreement between the property  
| owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a motion to correct an appraisal roll filed on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A motion to correct an appraisal roll  
| filed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law  
| in effect on the date the motion was filed, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| Section 151.004 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___151.004._ _____PROTECTION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS. (a) The_  
| _liberty of a parent regarding the care, custody, and control of the_  
| _parent's child is a fundamental right that resides first in the_  
| _parent._  
|  _(b) It is presumed that:_  
|  _(1) a parent is a fit parent; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a fit parent acts in the best interest of the_  
| _child._  
|  _(c)_ _____For purposes of Subsection (b), a parent may be_  
| _determined to not be a fit parent only by clear and convincing_  
| _evidence that the parent does not adequately care for the parent's_  
| _child._  
|  _(d)_ _____The state, or an agency or political subdivision of the_  
| _state, may not restrict or interfere with a parent's fundamental_  
| _right to make decisions in the raising of the parent's child unless_

| _interest; and_  
|  _(2) is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest._

| _Subsection (b); and_  
|  _(2) finds that:_

| _significant impairment of the child's physical health or emotional_  
| _well-being._  
|  _(f)_ _____This section does not limit the right of the state or an_  
| _agency or political subdivision of the state, in accordance with_  
| _the United States Constitution and applicable state and federal_  
| _law, to investigate or take action based on a report of child abuse_  
| _or neglect allegedly committed by a person responsible for a_  
| _child's care, custody, or welfare._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 153.002, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 153.002. BEST INTEREST OF CHILD.  _(a)_ The best  
| interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of  
| the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and  
| possession of and access to the child.  
|  _(b) It is presumed that:_  
|  _(1) a parent is a fit parent; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____a fit parent acts in the best interest of the_  
| _child._  
|  _(c)_ _____For purposes of Subsection (b), a parent may be_  
| _determined to not be a fit parent only by clear and convincing_  
| _evidence that the parent does not adequately care for the parent's_  
| _child._  
|  SECTION 4. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a suit affecting the parent-child relationship pending in a trial  
| court on the effective date of this Act or filed on or after that  
| date. A suit affecting the parent-child relationship in which a  
| final order is rendered before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the order was rendered,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

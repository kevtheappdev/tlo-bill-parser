| exemption if:  
|  (1) prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit

| follows:  
|  (b) If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead

| or 11.134 applicable to a property on January 1 of a year terminated  
| during the year and if the owner of the property qualifies a  
| different property for one of those residence homestead exemptions  
| during the same year, the tax due against the former residence  
| homestead is calculated by:

|  (A) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner qualified for the residence homestead exemption for the  
| entire year; from  
|  (B) the amount of the taxes that otherwise would  
| be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had  
| the owner not qualified for the residence homestead exemption  
| during the year;  
|  (2) multiplying the remainder determined under  
| Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and  
| the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the  
| date the exemption terminated; and  
|  (3) adding the product determined under Subdivision  
| (2) and the amount described by Subdivision (1)(A).  
|  SECTION 5. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year that begins on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,

| unit to adopt a local option exemption from ad valorem taxation of  
| an amount not to exceed $15,000 of the appraised value of the  
| residence homesteads of certain volunteer first responders is  
| approved by the voters. If that amendment is not approved by the  
| voters, this Act has no effect.

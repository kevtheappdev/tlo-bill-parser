|  _(4)_ _____the owner provides the school with a disclosure_  
| _document stating the amount by which the taxes on the real property_  
| _are reduced as a result of the exemption and the method the owner_  
| _will implement to ensure that the rent charged for the lease of the_  
| _property fully reflects that reduction; and_  
|  _(5)_ _____the rent charged for the lease of the real property_  
| _reflects the reduction in the amount of taxes on the property_  
| _resulting from the exemption through a monthly or annual credit_  
| _against the rent._  
|  _(b)_ _____Section 25.07 does not apply to a leasehold interest in_

|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to exempt from  
| ad valorem taxation real property leased to certain schools  
| organized and operated primarily for the purpose of engaging in  
| educational functions is approved by the voters. If that amendment  
| is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

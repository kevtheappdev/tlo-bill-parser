| _by excess loss, stop-loss, or reinsurance policies, the_  
| _commissioner, using the gross health benefit plan premiums reported_  
| _for the preceding calendar year by health benefit plan issuers_

| _the assessment would endanger the ability of the health benefit_  
| _plan issuer to fulfill its contractual obligations._  
|  _(b)_ _____If all or part of an assessment against a health benefit_  
| _plan issuer is abated or deferred, the amount of the abatement or_  
| _deferment shall be assessed against the other health benefit plan_  
| _issuers in a manner consistent with the method for computing_

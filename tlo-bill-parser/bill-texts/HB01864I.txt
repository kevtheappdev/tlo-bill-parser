| holder _or enrollee_ before a copy of the summary document is

_or_  
| _enrollee_. The document must also be available on request of a  
| _policy, contract, or certificate holder or enrollee_  
| [ ~~policyholder~~ ].  
|  (d) The distribution, delivery, content, or interpretation  
| of a summary document does not guarantee that a policy or contract  
| or a policy _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] contract _, or certificate_ holder _or enrollee_
is  
| provided coverage by this chapter if a member insurer becomes  
| impaired or insolvent.  Failure to receive the document does not  
| give an insured or policy, contract, or certificate holder _or_  
| _enrollee_ any rights greater than those provided by this chapter.  
|  (e) An insurer or agent may not deliver a policy or contract  
| described by Section 463.202 that is excluded from the coverage  
| provided by this chapter by Section 463.203 unless the insurer or  
| agent, either before or in conjunction with delivery, gives the  
| policy _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] contract _, or certificate_ holder _or enrollee_ a
separate  
| written notice clearly and conspicuously disclosing that the policy  
| or contract is not covered by the association.  
|  SECTION 11. Section 463.153, Insurance Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (c) and adding Subsection (b-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) Class B assessments _on_ [ ~~against~~ ] a member insurer for  
| each account under Section 463.105 shall be authorized and called  
| in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this  
| state by the _member_ insurer on policies or contracts covered by each  
| account for the three most recent calendar years for which  
| information is available preceding the year in which the _impaired_  
| _or insolvent member_ insurer became impaired or insolvent bear to  
| premiums received on business in this state for those calendar  
| years by all assessed member insurers.  _Except for assessments_  
| _related to long-term care insurance as described by Subsection_  
| _(b-1), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] amount of a Class B assessment shall be allocated  
| among the separate accounts in accordance with an allocation  
| formula that may be based on:  
|  (1) the premiums or reserves of the impaired or  
| insolvent insurer; or  
|  (2) any other standard deemed by the board in the  
| board's sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the  
| circumstances.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The amount of a Class B assessment for long-term care_  
| _insurance written by an impaired or insolvent member insurer shall_  
| _be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of_  
| _operation and approved by the commissioner. The methodology must_  
| _provide for 50 percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident_  
| _and health member insurers and 50 percent to be allocated to life_  
| _and annuity member insurers. This subsection does not apply to a_  
| _rider to a member insurer's life insurance policy or annuity_  
| _contract that provides long-term care benefits._  
|  (c) The total amount of assessments on a member insurer for  
| each account under Section 463.105 may not in one calendar year  
| exceed two percent of the insurer's average annual premiums on the  
| policies covered by the account during the three calendar years  
| preceding the year in which the _impaired or insolvent member_  
| insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.  If two or more  
| assessments are authorized in a calendar year with respect to  
| _member_ insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different  
| calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the  
| aggregate assessment percentage limitation described by this  
| subsection shall be equal to the higher of the three-year average  
| annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as  
| computed in accordance with this section.  If the maximum  
| assessment and the other assets of the association do not provide in  
| a year an amount sufficient to carry out the association's  
| responsibilities, the association shall make necessary additional  
| assessments as soon as this chapter permits.  
|  SECTION 12. Sections 463.154 and 463.201, Insurance Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 463.154. DEFERMENT. The association may wholly or  
| partly defer an assessment _on_ [ ~~of~~ ] a member insurer if the  
| association believes payment of the assessment would endanger the  
| ability of the insurer to fulfill the insurer's contractual  
| obligations.  The amount of the assessment that is deferred may be  
| assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent  
| with this subchapter.  
|  Sec. 463.201. _PERSONS_ [ ~~INSUREDS~~ ] COVERED. (a) Subject to  
| Subsections (b) and (c), this chapter provides coverage for a  
| policy or contract described by Section 463.202 to a person who is:  
|  (1) a person, other than a certificate holder under a  
| group policy or contract who is not a resident, who is a  
| beneficiary, assignee, or payee _, including a health care provider_  
| _who renders services covered under a health insurance policy or_  
| _certificate,_ of a person described by Subdivision (2);  
|  (2) a person who is an owner of or certificate holder __  
| _or enrollee_ under a policy or contract specified by Section  
| 463.202, other than an unallocated annuity contract or structured  
| settlement annuity, and who is:  
|  (A) a resident; or  
|  (B) not a resident, but only under all of the  
| following conditions:  
|  (i) the _member_ insurers that issued the  
| policies or contracts are domiciled in this state;  
|  (ii) the state in which the person resides  
| has an association similar to the association; and  
|  (iii) the person is not eligible for  
| coverage by an association in any other state because the insurer _or_  
| _health maintenance organization_ was not licensed in the state at  
| the time specified in that state's guaranty association law;  
|  (3) a person who is the owner of an unallocated annuity  
| contract issued to or in connection with:  
|  (A) a benefit plan whose plan sponsor has the  
| sponsor's principal place of business in this state; or  
|  (B) a government lottery, if the owner is a  
| resident; or  
|  (4) a person who is the payee under a structured  
| settlement annuity, or beneficiary of the payee if the payee is  
| deceased, if:  
|  (A) the payee is a resident, regardless of where  
| the contract owner resides;  
|  (B) the payee is not a resident, the contract  
| owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident, and the  
| payee is not eligible for coverage by the association in the state  
| in which the payee resides; or  
|  (C) the payee and the contract owner are not  
| residents, the insurer that issued the structured settlement  
| annuity is domiciled in this state, the state in which the contract  
| owner resides has an association similar to the association, and  
| neither the payee or, if applicable, the payee's beneficiary, nor  
| the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association in  
| the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.  
|  (b) This chapter does not provide coverage to:  
|  (1) a person who is a payee or the beneficiary of a  
| payee with respect to a contract the owner of which is a resident of  
| this state, if the payee or the payee's beneficiary is afforded any  
| coverage by the association of another state; [ ~~or~~ ]  
|  (2) a person otherwise described by Subsection (a)(3),  
| if any coverage is provided by the association of another state to  
| that person _; or_  
|  _(3)_ _____a person who acquires rights to receive payments_  
| _through a structured settlement factoring transaction as defined by_  
| _Section 5891(c)(3)(A), Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C._  
| _Section 5891(c)(3)(A)), regardless of whether the transaction_  
| _occurred before, on, or after the date that section became_  
| _effective_.  
|  (c) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to persons  
| who are residents of this state, and in those limited circumstances  
| as described in this chapter, to nonresidents.  In order to avoid  
| duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive  
| coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of  
| any other state, the person may not be provided coverage under this  
| chapter.  In determining the application of the provisions of this  
| subsection in situations in which a person could be covered by the  
| association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee,  
| _enrollee,_ beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed  
| in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only  
| one association.

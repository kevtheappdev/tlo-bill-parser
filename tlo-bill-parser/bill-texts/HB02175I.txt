|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the threshold contract amount at which a county is  
| required to engage in a competitive purchasing procedure for  
| certain purchases.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 252.312(b) and (c), Transportation  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) If the county road engineer so recommends and the  
| commissioners court considers it to be in the best interest of the  
| county, a purchase in an amount of _$50,000_ [ ~~$25,000~~ ] or less may be  
| made through negotiation by the commissioners court or the court's  
| authorized representative on requisition to be approved by the  
| commissioners court or the county auditor without advertising for  
| competitive bids.  
|  (c) A purchase may not be divided or reduced to avoid the  
| competitive bidding requirement on a purchase that would otherwise  
| cost more than _$50,000_ [ ~~$25,000~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a purchase commenced on or after September 1, 2019. A purchase  
| for which competitive bids are advertised before September 1, 2019,  
| is governed by the law in effect on the date the bids were  
| advertised, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the system for appraising property for ad valorem tax  
| purposes.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 403.302(a) and (a-2), Government Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) _Every two years, the_ [ ~~The~~ ] comptroller shall conduct a  
| study using comparable sales and generally accepted auditing and  
| sampling techniques to determine the total taxable value of all  
| property in each school district. The study shall determine the  
| taxable value of all property and of each category of property in  
| the district and the productivity value of all land that qualifies  
| for appraisal on the basis of its productive capacity and for which  
| the owner has applied for and received a productivity appraisal.  
| The comptroller shall make appropriate adjustments in the study to  
| account for actions taken under Chapter 41, Education Code.  
|  (a-2) _In a_ [ ~~If in any~~ ] year _in which_ the comptroller does not  
| conduct a study _for a school district_ , the _taxable value of property_  
| _in the district is presumed to be:_  
|  _(1) the_ [ ~~school~~ ] district's local value for that year __  
| _if the most recent study for the district resulted in a_  
| _determination by the comptroller that the district's local value_  
| _was:_  
|  _(A) valid; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____not valid and exceeded the comptroller's_  
| _value for the district; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the comptroller's value for the district from the_  
| _most recent study if the study resulted in a determination by the_  
| _comptroller that the district's local value was not valid and did_  
| _not exceed the comptroller's value_ [ ~~is considered to be valid~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. Section 5.10(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) _Every_ [ ~~At least once every~~ ] two years, the comptroller  
| shall conduct a study in each appraisal district to determine the  
| degree of uniformity of and the median level of appraisals by the  
| appraisal district within each major category of property.  The  
| comptroller shall publish a report of the findings of the study,  
| including in the report the median levels of appraisal for each  
| major category of property, the coefficient of dispersion around  
| the median level of appraisal for each major category of property,  
| and any other standard statistical measures that the comptroller  
| considers appropriate.  In conducting the study, the comptroller  
| shall apply appropriate standard statistical analysis techniques  
| to data collected as part of the study of school district taxable  
| values required by Section 403.302, Government Code.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 23.01, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsection (e) and adding Subsection (h) to read as follows:  
|  (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the  
| contrary, if the appraised value of property in a tax year is  
| lowered under Subtitle F, the appraised value of the property as  
| finally determined under that subtitle is considered to be the  
| appraised value of the property for that tax year.  [ ~~In the~~  
|  ~~following tax year, the chief appraiser may not increase the~~  
|  ~~appraised value of the property unless the increase by the chief~~  
|  ~~appraiser is reasonably supported by substantial evidence when all~~  
|  ~~of the reliable and probative evidence in the record is considered~~  
|  ~~as a whole.~~ ~~~~ ~~If the appraised value is finally determined in a~~  
|  ~~protest under Section 41.41(a)(2) or an appeal under Section 42.26,~~  
|  ~~the chief appraiser may satisfy the requirement to reasonably~~  
|  ~~support by substantial evidence an increase in the appraised value~~  
|  ~~of the property in the following tax year by presenting evidence~~  
|  ~~showing that the inequality in the appraisal of property has been~~  
|  ~~corrected with regard to the properties that were considered in~~  
|  ~~determining the value of the subject property.~~ ~~~~ ~~The burden of
proof~~  
|  ~~is on the chief appraiser to support an increase in the appraised~~  
|  ~~value of property under the circumstances described by this~~  
|  ~~subsection.~~ ]  
|  _(h)_ _____The chief appraiser has the burden of supporting an_  
| _increase in the appraised value of property from the preceding tax_  
| _year._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 23.013(b), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (b) A sale is not considered to be a comparable sale unless  
| the sale occurred within 24 months of the date as of which the  
| market value of the subject property is to be determined[ ~~, except~~  
|  ~~that a sale that did not occur during that period may be considered~~  
|  ~~to be a comparable sale if enough comparable properties were not~~  
|  ~~sold during that period to constitute a representative sample~~ ].  
|  SECTION 5. Section 25.18, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsection (b) and adding Subsections (b-1), (b-2), (b-3), and  
| (b-4) to read as follows:

| activities for all real and personal property in the district at  
| least once every three years _, except as provided by Subsections_  
| _(b-1), (b-2), (b-3), and (b-4)_ :  
|  (1) identifying properties to be appraised through  
| physical inspection or by other reliable means of identification,  
| including deeds or other legal documentation, aerial photographs,  
| land-based photographs, surveys, maps, and property sketches;  
|  (2) identifying and updating relevant characteristics  
| of each property in the appraisal records;  
|  (3) defining market areas in the district;

|  (C) legal and economic attributes; and  
|  (D) easements, covenants, leases, reservations,  
| contracts, declarations, special assessments, ordinances, or legal  
| restrictions;  
|  (5) developing an appraisal model that reflects the  
| relationship among the property characteristics affecting value in  
| each market area and determines the contribution of individual  
| property characteristics;  
|  (6) applying the conclusions reflected in the model to  
| the characteristics of the properties being appraised; and  
|  (7) reviewing the appraisal results to determine  
| value.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The plan shall provide for the reappraisal of all real_  
| _and personal property in the district not more often than once every_  
| _two years._  
|  _(b-2)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (b-1), at any time during_

| _the chief appraiser, for a tax year in which real property is not_  
| _reappraised, to add to the market value of the property the amount_  
| _of any increase in the value of the property attributable to an_  
| _improvement to the property made during the preceding tax year._  
|  _(b-4)_ _____Subsection (b-1) does not apply to the appraisal of a_  
| _residence homestead in the tax year in which a limitation on_  
| _appraised value under Section 23.23(a) expires._  
|  SECTION 6. Section 403.302(a-1), Government Code, is  
| repealed.  
|  SECTION 7. The changes in law made by this Act to Sections  
| 23.01, 23.013, and 25.18, Tax Code, apply only to the appraisal of  
| property for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.

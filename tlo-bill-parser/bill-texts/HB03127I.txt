|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the maximum amount of the local option residence  
| homestead exemption from ad valorem taxation by a taxing unit.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.13(n), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (n) In addition to any other exemptions provided by this  
| section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation by  
| a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of _the_  
| _individual's_ [ ~~his~~ ] residence homestead if the exemption is adopted  
| by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner  
| provided by law for official action by the body. If the percentage  
| set by the taxing unit produces an exemption in a tax year of less  
| than $5,000 when applied to a particular residence homestead, the  
| individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 of the appraised  
| value. The percentage adopted by the taxing unit may not exceed _100_  
| [ ~~20~~ ] percent.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year that begins on or after the effective date of this  
| Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, to increase the maximum amount of the local  
| option residence homestead exemption from ad valorem taxation by a  
| political subdivision is approved by the voters.  If that amendment  
| is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to information a law enforcement agency is required to  
| share with a school district about a person who may be a student.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 15.27, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsection (k-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) A law enforcement agency that arrests any person or  
| refers a child to the office or official designated by the juvenile  
| board who the agency believes is enrolled as a student in a public  
| primary or secondary school, for an offense listed in Subsection  
| (h), shall attempt to ascertain whether the person is so enrolled.  
| If the law enforcement agency ascertains that the individual is  
| enrolled as a student in a public primary or secondary school, the  
| head of the agency or a person designated by the head of the agency  
| shall orally notify the superintendent or a person designated by  
| the superintendent in the school district in which the student is  
| enrolled of that arrest or referral within 24 hours after the arrest  
| or referral is made, or before the next school day, whichever is  
| earlier. If the law enforcement agency cannot ascertain whether  
| the individual is enrolled as a student, the head of the agency or a  
| person designated by the head of the agency shall orally notify the  
| superintendent or a person designated by the superintendent in the  
| school district in which the student is believed to be enrolled of  
| that arrest or detention within 24 hours after the arrest or  
| detention, or before the next school day, whichever is earlier. If  
| the individual is a student, the superintendent or the  
| superintendent's designee shall immediately notify all  
| instructional and support personnel who have responsibility for  
| supervision of the student. All personnel shall keep the  
| information received in this subsection confidential. The State  
| Board for Educator Certification may revoke or suspend the  
| certification of personnel who intentionally violate this  
| subsection. Within seven days after the date the oral notice is  
| given, the head of the law enforcement agency or the person  
| designated by the head of the agency shall mail written  
| notification, marked "PERSONAL and CONFIDENTIAL" on the mailing  
| envelope, to the superintendent or the person designated by the  
| superintendent. The written notification must include the facts  
| contained in the oral notification, the name of the person who was  
| orally notified, and the date and time of the oral notification.  
| Both the oral and written notice shall contain sufficient details  
| of the arrest or referral and the acts allegedly committed by the  
| student to enable the superintendent or the superintendent's  
| designee to determine whether there is a reasonable belief that the  
| student has engaged in conduct defined as a felony offense by the  
| Penal Code _or whether it is necessary to conduct a threat assessment_  
| _or prepare a safety plan related to the student_. The information  
| contained in the notice shall be considered by the superintendent  
| or the superintendent's designee in making such a determination.

| _student. A school board may enter into a memorandum of_  
| _understanding with a law enforcement agency regarding the exchange_  
| _of information relevant to conducting a threat assessment or_  
| _preparing a safety plan. Absent a memorandum of understanding, the_  
| _information requested by the superintendent or the_

| a student has engaged in conduct defined as a felony offense by the

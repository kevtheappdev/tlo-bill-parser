|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a limitation on the total amount of ad valorem taxes  
| that may be imposed by a taxing unit on the residence homestead of a  
| lower-income individual that is located in a homestead preservation  
| district.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 11, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 11.262 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___11.262._ _____LIMITATION OF TAX ON CERTAIN HOMESTEADS IN_  
| _HOMESTEAD PRESERVATION DISTRICT. (a)_ ___In this section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____"Homestead preservation district" means a_  
| _district as that term is defined by Section 373A.002, Local_  
| _Government Code._  
|  _(2)_ _____"Lower-income individual" means an individual_  
| _whose household income, for the household located at the_  
| _individual's residence homestead, is not greater than 60 percent of_  
| _the area median family income, adjusted for household size, for the_  
| _metropolitan statistical area in which the residence homestead is_  
| _located, as determined annually by the United States Department of_  
| _Housing and Urban Development._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 11.13._  
|  _(b)_ _____The governing body of a taxing unit may by official_  
| _action adopt a limitation on the total annual amount of ad valorem_  
| _taxes that may be imposed by the taxing unit on the residence_  
| _homestead of a lower-income individual that is located in a_  
| _homestead preservation district._  
|  _(c)_ _____If a taxing unit adopts the limitation under this_  
| _section, the taxing unit may not increase the total annual amount of_  
| _ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit on a residence homestead_  
| _described by Subsection (b) to an amount that exceeds the greater_  
| _of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the amount of ad valorem taxes the taxing unit_  
| _imposed on the residence homestead in the first tax year in which:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the limitation under this section was in_  
| _effect; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____the lower-income individual received a_  
| _residence homestead exemption for the property; or_  
|  _(2) the amount determined under Subsection (d)._  
|  _(d)_ _____If an individual makes an improvement to a residence_  
| _homestead to which the limitation under this section applies, other_  
| _than a repair and other than an improvement required to comply with_  
| _governmental requirements, a taxing unit that has adopted the_  
| _limitation may increase the amount of taxes on the homestead for the_  
| _first tax year the value of the homestead is increased on the_  
| _appraisal roll as a result of the improvement. The amount of the tax_  
| _increase is determined by applying the current tax rate of the_  
| _taxing unit to the difference between the appraised value of the_  
| _homestead with the improvement and the appraised value the_  
| _homestead would have had without the improvement. A limitation_  
| _under this section then applies to the increased amount of taxes_  
| _imposed by the taxing unit on the residence homestead until another_  
| _improvement is made._  
|  _(e)_ _____An improvement to property that would otherwise_  
| _constitute an improvement under Subsection (d) is not treated as an_  
| _improvement under that subsection if the improvement is a_  
| _replacement structure for a structure that was rendered_  
| _uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage._  
| _For purposes of appraising the property in the tax year in which the_  
| _structure would have constituted an improvement under Subsection_  
| _(d), the replacement structure is considered to be an improvement_  
| _under that subsection only if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the square footage of the replacement structure_  
| _exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed_  
| _before the casualty or damage occurred; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the exterior of the replacement structure is of_  
| _higher quality construction and composition than that of the_  
| _replaced structure._  
|  _(f)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (h), (i), or (j), a_  
| _limitation under this section expires on January 1 if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the property is not the residence homestead of the_  
| _individual entitled to the limitation for the preceding tax year;_  
| _or_  
|  _(2)_ _____none of the owners of the property qualify as a_  
| _lower-income individual._  
|  _(g)_ _____If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised_  
| _value for a prior year because a limitation under this section was_  
| _erroneously allowed, the tax assessor for the taxing unit shall add_  
| _as back taxes due, as provided by Section 26.09(d), the positive_  
| _difference if any between the tax that should have been imposed for_  
| _that tax year and the tax that was imposed because of the provisions_  
| _of this section._  
|  _(h)_ _____If an individual who qualifies for a limitation under_  
| _this section dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is_  
| _entitled to the limitation on taxes imposed by the taxing unit on_  
| _the residence homestead of the individual if the homestead of the_  
| _individual:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse_  
| _on the date that the individual dies; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____remains the residence homestead of the surviving_  
| _spouse._  
|  _(i)_ _____The limitation under this section does not expire_  
| _because the owner of an interest in the property conveys the_  
| _interest to a qualifying trust as defined in Section 11.13(j) if the_  
| _owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the trust and is_  
| _entitled to occupy the property._  
|  _(j)_ _____A limitation under this section does not expire if the_  
| _owner of the structure qualifies for an exemption under Section_  
| _11.13 under the circumstances described in Section 11.135(a)._  
|  _(k)_ _____For each school district in an appraisal district that_  
| _adopts the limitation under this section, the chief appraiser shall_  
| _determine the portion of the appraised value of residence_  
| _homesteads of individuals on which school district taxes are not_  
| _imposed in a tax year because of the limitation under this section._  
| _That portion is calculated by determining the taxable value that,_  
| _if multiplied by the tax rate adopted by the school district for the_  
| _tax year, would produce an amount equal to the amount of tax that_  
| _would have been imposed by the school district on those homesteads_  
| _if the limitation under this section was not in effect, but that was_  
| _not imposed because of that limitation. The chief appraiser shall_  
| _determine that taxable value and certify it to the comptroller as_  
| _soon as practicable for each tax year._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 23.19(b) and (g), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) If an appraisal district receives a written request for  
| the appraisal of real property and improvements of a cooperative  
| housing corporation according to the separate interests of the  
| corporation's stockholders, the chief appraiser shall separately  
| appraise the interests described by Subsection (d) if the  
| conditions required by Subsections (e) and (f) have been met.  
| Separate appraisal under this section is for the purposes of  
| administration of tax exemptions, determination of applicable  
| limitations of taxes under Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261, _or 11.262,_  
| and apportionment by a cooperative housing corporation of property  
| taxes among its stockholders but is not the basis for determining  
| value on which a tax is imposed under this title. A stockholder  
| whose interest is separately appraised under this section may  
| protest and appeal the appraised value in the manner provided by  
| this title for protest and appeal of the appraised value of other  
| property.  
|  (g) A tax bill or a separate statement accompanying the tax  
| bill to a cooperative housing corporation for which interests of  
| stockholders are separately appraised under this section must  
| state, in addition to the information required by Section 31.01,  
| the appraised value and taxable value of each interest separately  
| appraised. Each exemption claimed as provided by this title by a  
| person entitled to the exemption shall also be deducted from the  
| total appraised value of the property of the corporation. The total  
| tax imposed by a _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district, county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college district~~ ] shall be reduced by any  
| amount that represents an increase in taxes attributable to  
| separately appraised interests of the real property and  
| improvements that are subject to the limitation of taxes prescribed  
| by Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261 _, or 11.262_. The corporation shall  
| apportion among its stockholders liability for reimbursing the  
| corporation for property taxes according to the relative taxable  
| values of their interests.

|  _(C)_ _____the current total value for a taxing unit_  
| _excludes the total value of homesteads that qualify for a tax_  
| _limitation provided by Section 11.262 applicable to the taxing_  
| _unit_.  
|  (13) "Last year's levy" means the total of:  
|  (A) the amount of taxes that would be generated

|  (i) taxable value that was reduced in an  
| appeal under Chapter 42; and  
|  (ii) all appraisal roll supplements and

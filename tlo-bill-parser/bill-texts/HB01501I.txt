| _PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT_  
| _ARTICLE I. PURPOSE_  
| _Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the_  
| _public through verification of education, training and experience_  
| _and ensure accountability for professional practice; and_  
| _Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day_  
| _practice of telepsychology (i.e. the provision of psychological_  
| _services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists_  
| _across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological_  
| _practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and_  
| _Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary_  
| _in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists_  
| _across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the_  
| _performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an_  
| _appropriate authority;_  
| _Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology_  
| _Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner_  
| _consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed_  
| _in another state;_  
| _Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest_  
| _in protecting the public's health and safety through their_  
| _licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state_  
| _regulation will best protect public health and safety;_  
| _Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is_  
| _licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and_  
| _Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person,_  
| _face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary_  
| _psychological practice._  
| _Consistent with these principles, this Compact is designed to_  
| _achieve the following purposes and objectives:_  
|  _1._ _____Increase public access to professional psychological_  
| _services by allowing for telepsychological practice_  
| _across state lines as well as temporary in-person,_  
| _face-to-face services into a state which the psychologist_  
| _is not licensed to practice psychology;_  
|  _2._ _____Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health_  
| _and safety, especially client/patient safety;_  
|  _3._ _____Encourage the cooperation of Compact States in the areas of_  
| _psychology licensure and regulation;_  
|  _4._ _____Facilitate the exchange of information between Compact_  
| _States regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions_

| relating to financially impaired fraternal benefit societies.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 885.311, Insurance Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsections (d) and (e) to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) A fraternal benefit society shall provide in the  
| fraternal benefit society's laws that if the society's reserves for  
| any class of the society's benefit certificates become impaired,  
| the society's supreme governing body or board of directors may  
| require the certificate holders to pay the society an equitable  
| proportion of the deficiency as determined by the governing body or  
| board.  _The aggregate assessment for the impaired reserves may not_  
| _exceed the total amount required to comply with Section 885.408._  
|  _(d)_ _____Not later than the 90th day before the proposed_  
| _effective date of an assessment under Subsection (a), the fraternal_  
| _benefit society shall file with the department an application for_  
| _approval of the assessment and a statement sworn to by the president_  
| _and secretary or corresponding officers of the society._ ___The_  
| _statement must:_  
|  _(1) include:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the terms of the assessment, including the_  
| _proposed effective date; and_

|  _(B)_ _____complies with the requirements of this_  
| _section._  
|  _(e)_ _____The commissioner shall approve or disapprove an_  
| _application under this section not later than the 60th day after the_

| _does not approve or disapprove the application before the_  
| _expiration of the 60-day period, the application is considered_  
| _approved. The commissioner may impose an effective date earlier_  
| _than the date requested in the application if the earlier effective_  
| _date is in the best interests of the certificate holders._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 885.407, Insurance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 885.407. SOLVENCY.  _(a)_ ___If a fraternal benefit society_  
| _reports a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control_  
| _level risk-based capital that triggers an authorized control level_

| _Section 7.402 and the commissioner reasonably believes the impaired_  
| _society's financial condition will not be promptly remedied without_

| _impaired society to promptly seek and negotiate an agreement to_  
| _transfer in accordance with this section all benefit members,_  
| _benefit certificates, assets, and liabilities of the impaired_

| _section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____may be by merger, consolidation, assumption, or_  
| _otherwise;_  
|  _(2)_ _____constitutes an entire novation of each benefit_  
| _certificate transferred by the impaired society, and the receiving_

| _commissioner;_  
|  _(4)_ _____may be approved by a vote of the majority of the_  
| _supreme governing body or board of directors of the impaired_  
| _society, notwithstanding Section 885.063 or any provision of the_  
| _impaired society's laws to the contrary; and_  
|  _(5) is subject to approval by the commissioner._  
|  _(b)_ _____Not later than the 30th day after the date the_

| _holders of the transfer._  
|  _(c)_ _____The supreme governing body or board of directors of a_  
| _fraternal benefit society receiving benefit certificates pursuant_  
| _to a transfer under an agreement described by Subsection (a) may_  
| _suspend or modify qualifications for membership in the receiving_  
| _society to the extent necessary to permit the society to accept the_  
| _certificate holders of the impaired society under the agreement,_  
| _notwithstanding any provision of the receiving society's laws to_  
| _the contrary._  
|  _(d)_ _____The commissioner may grant to a fraternal benefit_  
| _society that is not authorized to engage in the business of_  
| _insurance in this state the authority to service benefit_  
| _certificates transferred pursuant to Subsection (a) and fulfill all_  
| _obligations to the holders of the certificates._ ___Commissioner_  
| _action under this subsection does not authorize the fraternal_  
| _benefit society to otherwise engage in the business of insurance in_  
| _this state._  
|  _(e)_ _____A transfer under Subsection (a) may be made to an_  
| _insurer that is not a fraternal benefit society if the insurer is_  
| _authorized to engage in the business of insurance in this state._ ___A_  
| _holder of a certificate subject to a transfer as authorized by this_  
| _subsection is deemed to agree that any term in the certificate,_  
| _including a term that makes the certificate subject to the_  
| _transferring society's laws or that provides for maintenance of the_

| _subsection._  
|  _(f)_ _____The commissioner may request the attorney general bring_  
| _an action under Section 885.502 to terminate a fraternal benefit_  
| _society that fails to comply with an order under this section or_  
| _fails to remedy the financial condition that gave rise to the order._  
|  _(g)_ _____The powers and authority of the commissioner under this_  
| _section are cumulative and in addition to all other powers and_  
| _authority to remediate the financial condition of a fraternal_  
| _benefit society available to the commissioner, including the powers_  
| _and authority under 28 T.A.C. Section 7.402._ [ ~~A fraternal benefit~~  
|  ~~society is considered solvent if its admissible assets are equal to~~  
|  ~~or greater than its liabilities.~~ ]  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act to Section  
| 885.311, Insurance Code, apply only to an assessment by a fraternal  
| benefit society with an effective date on or after January 1, 2020.  
| An assessment by a fraternal benefit society with an effective date  
| before January 1, 2020, is governed by the law as it existed  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

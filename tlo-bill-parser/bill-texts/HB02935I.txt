| attendance for the school year for which the contract is executed;  
| or  
|  (2) the amount of the statewide district average of

|  (a) Sections [ ~~41.002(e),~~ ] 41.094, 41.097, and 41.098 apply  
| only to a district that:  
|  (1) executes an agreement to purchase all attendance  
| credits necessary to reduce the district's wealth per student to  
| the equalized wealth level;  
|  (2) executes an agreement to purchase attendance  
| credits and an agreement under Subchapter E to contract for the  
| education of nonresident students who transfer to and are educated  
| in the district but who are not charged tuition; or  
|  (3) executes an agreement under Subchapter E to  
| contract for the education of nonresident students:  
|  (A) to an extent that does not provide more than  
| 10 percent of the reduction in wealth per student required for the  
| district to achieve a wealth per student that is equal to or less  
| than the equalized wealth level; and  
|  (B) under which all revenue paid by the district  
| to other districts, in excess of the reduction in state aid that  
| results from counting the weighted average daily attendance of the  
| students served in the contracting district, is required to be used  
| for funding a consortium of at least three districts in a county  
| with a population of less than 40,000 that is formed to support a  
| technology initiative.  
|  SECTION 1.07. Sections 41.206(a), (f), (g), and (i),  
| Education Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The commissioner shall annex property detached under  
| Section 41.205 to school districts eligible for annexation in  
| accordance with this section. A school district is eligible for  
| annexation of property to it under this subchapter only if, before  
| any detachments or annexations are made in a year, the district's  
| wealth per student is less than the _equalized wealth level_  
| [ ~~greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F,~~  
|  ~~Chapter 42~~ ].  
|  (f) If only one school district is eligible to annex  
| property detached from a school district within a priority group  
| established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall  
| annex property to that district until it reaches a wealth per  
| student equal as nearly as possible to the _equalized wealth level_  
| [ ~~greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F,~~  
|  ~~Chapter 42,~~ ] by annexing whole parcels or items of property. Any  
| remaining detached property shall be annexed to eligible school  
| districts in the next priority group as provided by this section.  
|  (g) If more than one school district is eligible to annex  
| property detached from a school district within a priority group  
| established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall  
| first annex property to the district within the priority group to  
| which could be annexed the most taxable value of property without  
| increasing its wealth per student above the _equalized wealth level_  
| [ ~~greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F,~~  
|  ~~Chapter 42,~~ ] until that district reaches a wealth per student equal  
| as nearly as possible to the _equalized wealth level_ [ ~~greatest level~~  
|  ~~for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42,~~ ] by  
| annexing whole parcels or items of property. Then any additional  
| detached property shall be annexed in the same manner to other  
| eligible school districts in the same priority group in descending  
| order of capacity to receive taxable value of annexed property  
| without increasing the district's wealth per student above the  
| _equalized wealth level_ [ ~~greatest level for which funds are provided~~  
|  ~~under Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ]. If every school district in a  
| priority group reaches a wealth per student equal to the _equalized_  
| _wealth level_ [ ~~greatest level for which funds are provided under~~  
|  ~~Subchapter F, Chapter 42,~~ ] as nearly as possible, the remaining  
| detached property shall be annexed to school districts in the next  
| priority group in the manner provided by this section.  
|  (i) The commissioner may order the annexation of a portion  
| of a parcel or item of property, including a portion of property  
| treated as a whole parcel or item under Subsection (h), if:  
|  (1) the annexation of the whole parcel or item would  
| result in the district eligible to receive it in the appropriate  
| priority order provided by this section having a wealth per student  
| greater than $10,000 more than the _equalized wealth level_ [ ~~greatest~~  
|  ~~level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42~~ ];  
| or  
|  (2) the commissioner determines that annexation of  
| portions of the parcel or item would reduce disparities in district  
| wealth per student more efficiently than would be possible if the  
| parcel or item were annexed as a whole.  
|  SECTION 1.08. Section 41.257, Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 41.257. APPLICATION OF SMALL AND SPARSE ADJUSTMENTS  
| AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOTMENT. The budget of the consolidated  
| district must apply the benefit of the adjustment or allotment to  
| the schools of the consolidating district to which Section 42.103,  
| 42.105, or _42.202_ [ ~~42.155~~ ] would have applied in the event that the  
| consolidated district still qualifies as a small or sparse  
| district.

| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 42.002. PURPOSES OF FOUNDATION SCHOOL PROGRAM. [ ~~(a)~~ ]

|  SECTION 1.21. Sections 42.302, 42.303, and 42.304,  
| Education Code, are transferred to Subchapter B, Chapter 42,  
| Education Code, redesignated as Sections 42.107, 42.108, and  
| 42.109, Education Code, and amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. _42.107_ [ ~~42.302~~ ]. _GUARANTEED YIELD_ [ ~~ALLOTMENT~~ ]. (a)  
| Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount per weighted  
| student in state and local funds for each cent of tax effort [ ~~over~~  
|  ~~that required for the district's local fund assignment~~ ] up to the  
| maximum level specified in this subchapter.  The amount of state  
| support, subject only to the maximum amount under Section _42.108_  
| [ ~~42.303~~ ], is determined by the formula:  
| GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR  
| where:  
|  "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be  
| allocated to the district;  
|  "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local  
| funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is _, subject_  
| _to the adjustment under Subsection (a-1), $56_ [ ~~an amount described~~  
|  ~~by Subsection (a-1)~~ ] or a greater amount for any year provided by  
| appropriation;  
|  "WADA" _has the meaning assigned by Section 42.0053_ [ ~~is the~~  
|  ~~number of students in weighted average daily attendance, which is~~  
|  ~~calculated by dividing the sum of the school district's allotments~~  
|  ~~under Subchapters B and C, less any allotment to the district for~~  
|  ~~transportation, any allotment under Section 42.158 or 42.160, and~~  
|  ~~50 percent of the adjustment under Section 42.102, by the basic~~  
|  ~~allotment for the applicable year~~ ];  
|  "DTR" is the district [ ~~enrichment~~ ] tax rate of the school  
| district, which is determined by subtracting the _amount_ [ ~~amounts~~ ]  
| specified by Subsection (b) from the total amount of maintenance  
| and operations taxes collected by the school district for the  
| applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient  
| of the district's taxable value of property as determined under  
| Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable,  
| under Section 42.2521, divided by 100; and  
|  "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying  
| "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section 42.2521, divided by 100.  
|  (a-1) _Beginning with the 2021-2022 school year, the_  
| _guaranteed level provided under Subsection (a) is adjusted annually_  
| _to increase the guaranteed level by the greater of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____one percent of the amount of the guaranteed level_  
| _for the preceding school year; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the amount that results from applying the_  
| _inflation rate, as determined by the comptroller on the basis of_  
| _changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers_  
| _published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States_  
| _Department of Labor, to the guaranteed level for the preceding_  
| _school year._ [ ~~For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount~~  
|  ~~guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per~~  
|  ~~cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the greater of the amount of district tax revenue~~  
|  ~~per weighted student per cent of tax effort that would be available~~  
|  ~~to the Austin Independent School District, as determined by the~~  
|  ~~commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative Budget Board, if~~  
|  ~~the reduction of the limitation on tax increases as provided by~~  
|  ~~Section 11.26(a-1), (a-2), or (a-3), Tax Code, did not apply, or the~~  
|  ~~amount of district tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax~~  
|  ~~effort used for purposes of this subdivision in the preceding~~  
|  ~~school year, for the first six cents by which the district's~~  
|  ~~maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds the rate equal to the~~  
|  ~~sum of the product of the state compression percentage, as~~  
|  ~~determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year~~  
|  ~~and any additional tax effort included in calculating the~~  
|  ~~district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1); and~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~$31.95, for the district's maintenance and~~  
|  ~~operations tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort~~  
|  ~~described by Subdivision (1).~~  
|  [ ~~(a-2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~The limitation on district enrichment tax rate~~  
|  ~~("DTR") under Section 42.303 does not apply to the district's~~  
|  ~~maintenance and operations tax effort described by Subsection~~  
|  ~~(a-1)(1).~~ ]  
|  (b) In computing the district [ ~~enrichment~~ ] tax rate of a  
| school district, the total amount of maintenance and operations  
| taxes collected by the school district does not include the amount  
| of[ ~~:~~  
|  [ ~~(1)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the district's local fund assignment under~~  
|  ~~Section 42.252; or~~  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ] taxes paid into a tax increment fund under  
| Chapter 311, Tax Code.  
|  (c) For purposes of this section, school district taxes for  
| which credit is granted under Section 31.035, 31.036, or 31.037,  
| Tax Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as  
| if the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.  
|  (d) For purposes of this section, the total amount of  
| maintenance and operations taxes collected for an applicable school  
| year by a school district with alternate tax dates, as authorized by  
| Section 26.135, Tax Code, is the amount of taxes collected on or  
| after January 1 of the year in which the school year begins and not  
| later than December 31 of the same year.  
|  (e) For purposes of this section, school district taxes for  
| which credit is granted under former Subchapter D, Chapter 313, Tax  
| Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as if  
| the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.  
|  (f) If a school district imposes a maintenance and  
| operations tax at a rate greater than the rate equal to the product  
| of the state compression percentage, as determined under Section  
| 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax rate  
| adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year, the district is  
| entitled to receive _a guaranteed yield_ [ ~~an allotment~~ ] under this  
| section on the basis of that greater tax effort.  
|  Sec. _42.108_ [ ~~42.303~~ ]. LIMITATION ON _DISTRICT_ [ ~~ENRICHMENT~~ ]  
| TAX RATE. The district [ ~~enrichment~~ ] tax rate ("DTR") under Section  
| _42.107_ [ ~~42.302~~ ] may not exceed [ ~~the amount per $100 of valuation
by~~  
|  ~~which~~ ] the maximum rate permitted under Section 45.003 [ ~~exceeds
the~~  
|  ~~rate used to determine the district's local share under Section~~  
|  ~~42.252~~ ], or a greater amount for any year provided by  
| appropriation.  
|  Sec. _42.109_ [ ~~42.304~~ ]. COMPUTATION OF AID FOR DISTRICT ON  
| MILITARY RESERVATION OR AT STATE SCHOOL. State assistance under  
| this subchapter for a school district located on a federal military  
| installation or at Moody State School is computed using the average  
| tax rate and property value per student of school districts in the  
| county, as determined by the commissioner.  
|  SECTION 1.22. Subchapter B, Chapter 42, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 42.110 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___42.110._ _____MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM GAIN. (a) Notwithstanding_  
| _any other provision of this chapter, a school district is entitled_  
| _for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years to a minimum gain_  
| _guarantee of additional state aid in an amount equal to the lesser_  
| _of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the amount by which the district's state and local_  
| _revenue received for the applicable school year under Chapter 41_  
| _and this chapter is less than the state and local revenue received_  
| _by the district under Chapter 41 and this chapter for the 2018-2019_  
| _school year; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____$65 per student in weighted average daily_

| _district's state and local revenue would exceed that amount for the_  
| _applicable school year, the amount of state funds to which the_  
| _district would otherwise be entitled under this chapter shall be_  
| _reduced proportionately to comply with the maximum amount of_

| this subsection but is not otherwise subject to Subchapter C,  
| Chapter 29. For purposes of this subsection, a program  
| specifically designed to serve students at risk of dropping out of  
| school, as defined by Section 29.081, is considered to be a program  
| supplemental to the regular education program, and a district may  
| use its compensatory education _funds_ [ ~~allotment~~ ] for such a  
| program.  
|  _(c)_ [ ~~(c-1)~~ ] Notwithstanding Subsection _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ],  
| _compensatory education_ funds [ ~~allocated under this section~~ ] may be  
| used to fund in proportion to the percentage of students served by  
| the program that meet the criteria in Section 29.081(d) or (g):  
|  (1) an accelerated reading instruction program under  
| Section 28.006(g); or  
|  (2) a program for treatment of students who have  
| dyslexia or a related disorder as required by Section 38.003.

| _compensatory education_ funds [ ~~allocated under this section~~ ] may be  
| used to fund a _school_ district's mentoring services program under  
| Section 29.089.  
|  _(e)_ [ ~~(d)~~ ] The agency shall evaluate the effectiveness of  
| accelerated instruction and support programs provided under  
| Section 29.081 for students at risk of dropping out of school.  
|  _(f)_ [ ~~(q)~~ ] The State Board of Education, with the assistance  
| of the comptroller, shall develop and implement by rule reporting  
| and auditing systems for district and campus expenditures of  
| compensatory education funds to ensure that _those_ [ ~~compensatory~~  
|  ~~education~~ ] funds, other than the indirect cost _apportionment_  
| [ ~~allotment~~ ], are spent only to supplement the regular education  
| program as required by Subsection _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ]. The reporting  
| requirements shall be managed electronically to minimize local  
| administrative costs. A _school_ district shall submit the report  
| required by this subsection not later than the 150th day after the  
| last day permissible for resubmission of information required under  
| Section 42.006.  
|  _(g)_ [ ~~(q-1)~~ ] The commissioner shall develop a system to  
| identify school districts that are at high risk of having used  
| compensatory education funds other than in compliance with  
| Subsection _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ] or of having inadequately reported  
| compensatory education expenditures. If a review of the report  
| submitted under Subsection _(f)_ [ ~~(q)~~ ], using the risk-based system,  
| indicates that a district is not at high risk of having misused  
| compensatory education funds or of having inadequately reported  
| compensatory education expenditures, the district may not be  
| required to perform a local audit of compensatory education  
| expenditures and is not subject to on-site monitoring under this  
| section.  
|  _(h)_ [ ~~(q-2)~~ ] If a review of the report submitted under  
| Subsection _(f)_ [ ~~(q)~~ ], using the risk-based system, indicates that a  
| _school_ district is at high risk of having misused compensatory  
| education funds, the commissioner shall notify the district of that  
| determination. The district must respond to the commissioner not  
| later than the 30th day after the date the commissioner notifies the  
| district of the commissioner's determination. If the district's  
| response does not change the commissioner's determination that the  
| district is at high risk of having misused compensatory education  
| funds or if the district does not respond in a timely manner, the  
| commissioner shall:  
|  (1) require the district to conduct a local audit of  
| compensatory education expenditures for the current or preceding  
| school year;  
|  (2) order agency staff to conduct on-site monitoring  
| of the district's compensatory education expenditures; or  
|  (3) both require a local audit and order on-site  
| monitoring.  
|  _(i)_ [ ~~(q-3)~~ ] If a review of the report submitted under  
| Subsection _(f)_ [ ~~(q)~~ ], using the risk-based system, indicates that a  
| _school_ district is at high risk of having inadequately reported  
| compensatory education expenditures, the commissioner may require  
| agency staff to assist the district in following the proper  
| reporting methods or amending a district or campus improvement plan  
| under Subchapter F, Chapter 11. If the district does not take  
| appropriate corrective action before the 45th day after the date  
| the agency staff notifies the district of the action the district is  
| expected to take, the commissioner may:  
|  (1) require the district to conduct a local audit of  
| the district's compensatory education expenditures; or  
|  (2) order agency staff to conduct on-site monitoring  
| of the district's compensatory education expenditures.  
|  _(j)_ [ ~~(q-4)~~ ] The commissioner, in the year following a local  
| audit of compensatory education expenditures, shall withhold from a  
| _school_ district's foundation school fund payment an amount equal to  
| the amount of compensatory education funds the agency determines  
| were not used in compliance with Subsection _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ]. The  
| commissioner shall release to a district funds withheld under this  
| subsection when the district provides to the commissioner a  
| detailed plan to spend those funds in compliance with Subsection  
| _(b)_ [ ~~(c)~~ ].  
|  _(k)_ [ ~~(r)~~ ] The commissioner shall grant a one-year exemption  
| from the requirements of Subsections _(f), (g), (h), (i), and (j)_  
| [ ~~(q)-(q-4)~~ ] to a school district in which the group of students who  
| have failed to perform satisfactorily in the preceding school year  
| on an assessment instrument required under Section 39.023(a), (c),  
| or (l) subsequently performs on those assessment instruments at a  
| level that meets or exceeds a level prescribed by commissioner  
| rule. Each year the commissioner, based on the most recent  
| information available, shall determine if a school district is  
| entitled to an exemption for the following school year and notify  
| the district of that determination.

|  (c) Each _school_ district or county operating a regular  
| transportation system is entitled to an allotment based on the  
| daily cost per regular eligible student of operating and  
| maintaining the regular transportation system and the linear  
| density of that system. In determining the cost, the commissioner  
| shall give consideration to factors affecting the actual cost of  
| providing these transportation services in each district or county.  
| The average actual cost is to be computed by the commissioner and  
| included for consideration by the legislature in the General  
| Appropriations Act. The allotment per mile of approved route may  
| not exceed the amount set by appropriation.  
|  (d) A _school_ district or county may apply for and on  
| approval of the commissioner receive an additional amount of up to  
| 10 percent of its regular transportation allotment to be used for  
| the transportation of children living within two miles of the

| and children must walk along or cross a freeway or expressway, an  
| underpass, an overpass or a bridge, an uncontrolled major traffic  
| artery, an industrial or commercial area, or another comparable  
| condition. An area presents a high risk of violence if law  
| enforcement records indicate a high incidence of violent crimes in

| provided that the district or county requires each supported  
| program to submit a financial report to the district or county each  
| semester that covers services provided by the program for the  
| benefit of the district or county. The commissioner shall adopt  
| rules governing the transportation allotment as necessary to permit  
| a district or county to receive funds under Subsection (d) that may  
| be used to support innovative school safety projects, including  
| community walking transportation programs as provided by this  
| subsection and any other appropriate safety project, including  
| rules defining an approved walking route mile that may be used as  
| necessary in implementing this subsection.  
|  (e) The commissioner may grant an amount set by  
| appropriation for private or commercial transportation for  
| eligible students from isolated areas. The need for this type of  
| transportation grant shall be determined on an individual basis and  
| the amount granted shall not exceed the actual cost. The grants may  
| be made only in extreme hardship cases. A grant may not be made if  
| the students live within two miles of an approved school bus route.  
|  (f) The cost of transporting career and technology  
| education students from one campus to another inside a _school_  
| district or from a sending district to another secondary public  
| school for a career and technology program or an area career and  
| technology school or to an approved post-secondary institution  
| under a contract for instruction approved by the agency shall be  
| reimbursed based on the number of actual miles traveled times the  
| district's official extracurricular travel per mile rate as set by  
| the board of trustees and approved by the agency.  
|  (g) A school district or county that provides special  
| transportation services for eligible special education students is  
| entitled to a state allocation paid on a previous year's  
| cost-per-mile basis. The maximum rate per mile allowable shall be  
| set by appropriation based on data gathered from the first year of  
| each preceding biennium. Districts may use a portion of their  
| support allocation to pay transportation costs, if necessary. The  
| commissioner may grant an amount set by appropriation for private  
| transportation to reimburse parents or their agents for  
| transporting eligible special education students. The mileage  
| allowed shall be computed along the shortest public road from the  
| student's home to school and back, morning and afternoon. The need  
| for this type transportation shall be determined on an individual  
| basis and shall be approved only in extreme hardship cases.  
|  (h) Funds allotted under this section must be used in  
| providing transportation services.  
|  (i) In the case of a _school_ district belonging to a county  
| transportation system, the district's transportation allotment for  
| purposes of determining a district's _Foundation School Program_  
| [ ~~foundation school program~~ ] allocations is determined on the basis

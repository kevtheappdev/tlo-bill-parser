| end-of-course assessment instrument must be administered with the  
| aid of technology _, but may include one or more parts that prohibit_  
| _the use of technology_. The English I and English II end-of-course  
| assessment instruments must each assess essential knowledge and

| modification is necessary in administering to the student an  
| assessment instrument required under this subsection. The State  
| Board of Education shall administer the assessment instruments. _An_  
| _end-of-course assessment instrument may be administered in_  
| _multiple parts over more than one day_ [ ~~The State Board of Education~~

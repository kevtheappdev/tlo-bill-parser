|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a severance payment to a superintendent of a school  
| district.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.201(c), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (c) For purposes of this subsection, "severance payment"  
| means any amount paid by the board of trustees of an independent  
| school district to or in behalf of a superintendent on early  
| termination of the superintendent's contract that exceeds the  
| amount earned by the superintendent under the contract as of the  
| date of termination, including any amount that exceeds the amount  
| of earned standard salary and benefits that is paid as a condition  
| of early termination of the contract. _The board of trustees may not_  
| _make a severance payment to a superintendent in an amount greater_  
| _than one year's salary under the superintendent's terminated_  
| _contract._ The board of trustees that makes a severance payment to a  
| superintendent shall report the terms of the severance payment to  
| the commissioner. [ ~~The commissioner shall reduce the district's~~  
|  ~~Foundation School Program funds by any amount that the amount of the~~  
|  ~~severance payment to the superintendent exceeds an amount equal to~~  
|  ~~one year's salary and benefits under the superintendent's~~  
|  ~~terminated contract.~~ ] The commissioner may adopt rules as necessary  
| to administer this subsection.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 11.201(c), Education Code, as amended by  
| this Act, applies only to a severance payment made by the board of  
| trustees of an independent school district to a superintendent  
| under an agreement entered into on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A severance payment made by the board of trustees of an  
| independent school district to a superintendent under an agreement  
| entered into before the effective date of this Act is governed by  
| the law in effect at the time the agreement was made, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

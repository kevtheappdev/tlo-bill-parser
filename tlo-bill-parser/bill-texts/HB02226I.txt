|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to procedures for imposing certain administrative  
| penalties or disgorgement orders by the Public Utility Commission  
| of Texas.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 15.024(e) and (f), Utilities Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (e) If the person accepts the executive director's  
| determination and recommended penalty _or fails to timely respond to_  
| _the notice_ , the commission by order shall approve the determination  
| and impose the recommended penalty _or order a hearing on the_  
| _determination and the recommended penalty_.  
|  (f) If the person requests a hearing or _the commission_  
| _orders a hearing under Subsection (e)_ [ ~~fails to timely respond to~~  
|  ~~the notice~~ ], the executive director shall set a hearing and give  
| notice of the hearing to the person.  The parties to a proceeding  
| under this subchapter shall be limited to the person and the  
| commission, including the independent market monitor.  The hearing  
| shall be held by an administrative law judge of the State Office of  
| Administrative Hearings.  The administrative law judge shall make  
| findings of fact and conclusions of law and promptly issue to the  
| commission a proposal for a decision about the occurrence of the  
| violation and the amount of a proposed penalty.  Based on the  
| findings of fact, conclusions of law, and proposal for a decision,  
| the commission by order may find that a violation has occurred and  
| impose a penalty or disgorgement order or may find that no violation  
| occurred.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a person who receives notice under Section 15.024(b), Utilities  
| Code, on or after the effective date of this Act.  A person who  
| receives notice before the effective date of this Act is governed by  
| the law in effect on the date the person received notice, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

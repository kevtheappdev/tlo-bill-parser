| follows:  
|  Sec. _12.1509_ [ ~~12.052~~ ]. DAM SAFETY. (a) The commission  
| shall make and enforce rules and orders and shall perform all other  
| acts necessary to provide for the safe construction, maintenance,  
| repair, and removal of dams located in this state. In performing  
| the commission's duties under this subsection, the commission shall  
| identify and focus on the most hazardous dams in the state.  
|  (b) Rules and orders made by the commission shall be made  
| after proper notice and hearing as provided in the rules of the  
| commission.  
|  (b-1) The commission may enter into an agreement with an  
| owner of a dam who is required to reevaluate the adequacy of an  
| existing dam or spillway. The agreement may include timelines to  
| achieve compliance with the commission's design criteria and may  
| authorize deferral of compliance with the criteria, as appropriate.  
|  (c) If the owner of a dam that is required to be constructed,  
| reconstructed, repaired, or removed in order to comply with the  
| rules and orders promulgated under Subsection (a) of this section  
| wilfully fails or refuses to comply within the 30-day period  
| following the date of the commission's final, nonappealable order  
| to do so or if a person wilfully fails to comply with any rule or  
| other order issued by the commission under this section within the  
| 30-day period following the effective date of the order, he is  
| liable to a penalty of not more than $5,000 a day for each day he  
| continues to violate this section. The state may recover the  
| penalty by suit brought for that purpose in the district court of  
| Travis County.  
|  (d) If the commission determines that the existing  
| condition of the dam is creating or will cause extensive or severe  
| property damage or economic loss to others or is posing an immediate  
| and serious threat to human life or health and that other procedures  
| available to the commission to remedy or prevent the occurrence of  
| the situation will result in unreasonable delay, the commission may  
| issue an emergency order, either mandatory or prohibitory in  
| nature, directing the owner of a dam to repair, modify, maintain,  
| dewater, or remove the dam which the commission determines is  
| unsafe. The emergency order may be issued without notice to the dam  
| owner or with notice the commission considers practicable under the  
| circumstances. The notice does not have to comply with Chapter  
| 2001, Government Code.  
|  (e) If the commission issues an emergency order under  
| authority of this section without notice to the dam owner, the  
| commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing which shall be  
| held as soon as practicable to affirm, modify, or set aside the  
| emergency order. The notice does not have to comply with Chapter  
| 2001, Government Code. If the nature of the commission's action  
| requires further proceedings, those proceedings shall be conducted  
| as appropriate under Chapter 2001, Government Code.  
|  (e-1) The commission shall exempt an owner of a dam located  
| on private property from meeting requirements related to dam safety  
| if the dam:  
|  (1) at maximum capacity impounds less than 500  
| acre-feet;  
|  (2) has a hazard classification of low or significant;  
|  (3) is located in a county with a population of less  
| than 350,000; and  
|  (4) is not located inside the corporate limits of a  
| municipality.  
|  (e-2) Notwithstanding Subsection (e-1), an owner of a dam  
| shall comply with operation and maintenance requirements  
| established by commission rule.  
|  (f) Nothing in this section or in rules or orders made by the  
| commission shall be construed to relieve an owner or operator of a  
| dam or reservoir of the legal duties, obligations, or liabilities  
| incident to ownership or operation.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT

|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 42.013, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  Art. 42.013. FINDING OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. In the trial of an  
| offense under Title 5, _Penal Code, or Section 25.07, 25.071,_  
| _25.072, 25.11, or 42.072,_ Penal Code, if the court determines that  
| the offense involved family violence, as defined by Section 71.004,  
| Family Code, the court shall make an affirmative finding of that  
| fact and enter the affirmative finding in the judgment of the case.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 42A.504(b), Code of Criminal Procedure,  
| is amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) If a judge grants community supervision to a defendant  
| convicted of an offense [ ~~under Title 5, Penal Code,~~ ] that the court  
| determines involves family violence, the judge shall require the  
| defendant to pay $100 to a family violence center that:  
|  (1) receives state or federal funds; and  
|  (2) serves the county in which the court is located.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 81.0015, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 81.0015. PRESUMPTION. For purposes of this subtitle,  
| there is a presumption that family violence has occurred and is  
| likely to occur in the future if:  
|  (1) the respondent has been convicted of or placed on  
| deferred adjudication community supervision for any of the  
| following offenses against the child for whom the petition is  
| filed:  
|  (A) an offense [ ~~under Title 5, Penal Code,~~ ] for  
| which the court has made an affirmative finding that the offense

|  (3) the respondent is seeking or attempting to seek  
| contact with the child.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense was  
| committed before that date.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

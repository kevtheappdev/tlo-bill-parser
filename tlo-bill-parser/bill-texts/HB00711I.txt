| _chapter, the commissioner shall adjust the taxable value of_  
| _property of a district for a school year as necessary to ensure the_  
| _district's wealth per student does not exceed the equalized wealth_

| _for that school year the district:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is identified by the select committee under_  
| _Section 42.25273 as having a taxable value of property that is_  
| _unlikely to produce the projected district tax revenue per weighted_  
| _student because of a high prevalence of mineral rights associated_  
| _with the taxable property; and_

| _of each year, the select committee shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____in consultation with the comptroller and the_  
| _Legislative Budget Board, identify districts with a taxable value_  
| _of property that is unlikely to produce the projected district tax_  
| _revenue per weighted student because of a high prevalence of_  
| _mineral rights associated with the taxable property; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____provide to the commissioner a list of those_

|  SECTION 4. Section 42.302(a), Education Code, is amended to

|  (a) Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount  
| per weighted student in state and local funds for each cent of tax  
| effort over that required for the district's local fund assignment  
| up to the maximum level specified in this subchapter. The amount  
| of state support, subject only to the maximum amount under Section  
| 42.303, is determined by the formula:  
| GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR  
| where:  
|  "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be  
| allocated to the district;  
|  "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local  
| funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is an  
| amount described by Subsection (a-1) or a greater amount for any  
| year provided by appropriation;  
|  "WADA" is the number of students in weighted average daily  
| attendance, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the school  
| district's allotments under Subchapters B and C, less any allotment  
| to the district for transportation, any allotment under Section  
| 42.158 or 42.160, and 50 percent of the adjustment under Section  
| 42.102, by the basic allotment for the applicable year;  
|  "DTR" is the district enrichment tax rate of the school  
| district, which is determined by subtracting the amounts specified  
| by Subsection (b) from the total amount of maintenance and  
| operations taxes collected by the school district for the  
| applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient  
| of the district's taxable value of property as determined under  
| Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable,  
| under Section 42.2521, _42.25271, or 42.25272,_ divided by 100; and  
|  "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying  
| "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section 42.2521, _42.25271, or 42.25272,_ divided  
| by 100.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 46.003(a), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) For each year, except as provided by Sections 46.005 and  
| 46.006, a school district is guaranteed a specified amount per  
| student in state and local funds for each cent of tax effort, up to  
| the maximum rate under Subsection (b), to pay the principal of and  
| interest on eligible bonds issued to construct, acquire, renovate,  
| or improve an instructional facility. The amount of state support  
| is determined by the formula:  
| FYA = (FYL X ADA X BTR X 100) - (BTR X (DPV/100))  
| where:  
|  "FYA" is the guaranteed facilities yield amount of state  
| funds allocated to the district for the year;  
|  "FYL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and  
| local funds per student per cent of tax effort, which is $35 or a  
| greater amount for any year provided by appropriation;  
|  "ADA" is the greater of the number of students in average  
| daily attendance, as determined under Section 42.005, in the  
| district or 400;  
|  "BTR" is the district's bond tax rate for the current year,  
| which is determined by dividing the amount budgeted by the district  
| for payment of eligible bonds by the quotient of the district's  
| taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter M, Chapter  
| 403, Government Code, or, if applicable, Section 42.2521, _42.25271,_  
| _or 42.25272,_ divided by 100; and  
|  "DPV" is the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, Section 42.2521 _, 42.25271, or 42.25272_.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 46.006(g), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (g) In this section, "wealth per student" means a school  
| district's taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter  
| M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if applicable, Section  
| 42.2521, _42.25271, or 42.25272,_ divided by the district's average  
| daily attendance as determined under Section 42.005.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 46.032(a), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount  
| per student in state and local funds for each cent of tax effort to  
| pay the principal of and interest on eligible bonds. The amount of  
| state support, subject only to the maximum amount under Section  
| 46.034, is determined by the formula:  
| EDA = (EDGL X ADA X EDTR X 100) - (EDTR X (DPV/100))  
| where:  
|  "EDA" is the amount of state funds to be allocated to the  
| district for assistance with existing debt;  
|  "EDGL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and  
| local funds per student per cent of tax effort, which is the lesser  
| of:  
|  (1) $40 or a greater amount for any year provided by  
| appropriation; or  
|  (2) the amount that would result in a total additional  
| amount of state funds under this subchapter for the current year  
| equal to $60 million in excess of the state funds to which school  
| districts would have been entitled under this section if the  
| guaranteed level amount were $35;  
|  "ADA" is the number of students in average daily attendance,  
| as determined under Section 42.005, in the district;  
|  "EDTR" is the existing debt tax rate of the district, which is  
| determined by dividing the amount budgeted by the district for  
| payment of eligible bonds by the quotient of the district's taxable  
| value of property as determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403,  
| Government Code, or, if applicable, under Section 42.2521 _, 42.2571,_  
| _or 42.25272_ , divided by 100; and  
|  "DPV" is the district's taxable value of property as  
| determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, or, if  
| applicable, under Section 42.2521 _, 42.25271, or 42.25272_.  
|  SECTION 8. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the sale by certain municipalities of leased land  
| located near the shoreline of a lake.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 272.001(h), Local Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (h) A municipality having a population of _1.5 million_  
| [ ~~825,000~~ ] or less and owning land within 5,000 feet of where the  
| shoreline of a lake would be if the lake were filled to its storage  
| capacity may, without notice or the solicitation of bids, sell the  
| land to the person leasing the land for the fair market value of the  
| land as determined by a certified appraiser. While land described  
| by this subsection is under lease, the municipality owning the land  
| may not sell the land to any person other than the person leasing  
| the land. To protect the public health, safety, or welfare and to  
| ensure an adequate municipal water supply, property sold by the  
| municipality under this subsection is not eligible for and the  
| owner is not entitled to the exemption provided by Section  
| 11.142(a), Water Code. The instrument conveying property under  
| this subsection must include a provision stating that the exemption  
| does not apply to the conveyance. In this subsection, "lake" means  
| an inland body of standing water, including a reservoir formed by  
| impounding the water of a river or creek but not including an  
| impoundment of salt water or brackish water, that has a storage  
| capacity of more than 10,000 acre-feet.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

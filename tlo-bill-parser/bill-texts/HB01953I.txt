|  Sec. 361.119. REGULATION OF CERTAIN FACILITIES AS SOLID  
| WASTE FACILITIES.  
|  _(d)_ _____A facility that reuses or converts recyclable_  
| _materials, including post-use polymers and recoverable feedstocks,_  
| _in a pyrolysis or gasification process, and the operations_  
| _conducted and materials handled at the facility, are not subject to_  
| _regulation under rules adopted under this section if the owner or_  
| _operator of the facility demonstrates that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the primary function of the facility is to convert_  
| _materials that have a resale value greater than the cost of_  
| _converting the materials for subsequent beneficial use; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____all the solid waste generated from converting the_  
| _materials is disposed of in a solid waste facility authorized under_  
| _this chapter, with the exception of small amounts of solid waste_  
| _that may be inadvertently and unintentionally disposed of in_  
| _another manner._  
|  (d) _(e)_ A facility that is owned, operated, or affiliated  
| with a person that has a permit to dispose of municipal solid waste  
| is not subject to regulation or requirements for financial  
| assurance under rules adopted under this section.  
|  (e) _(f)_ A solid waste processing facility that is owned or  
| operated by a local government is not subject to rules adopted under  
| this section.  
|  (f) _(g)_ The commission shall adopt rules to ensure that the  
| owner or operator of a recycling facility, including a composting  
| or mulching facility, has in place sufficient financial assurance  
| conditioned on satisfactorily operating and closing the facility  
| and consistent with the requirements of Section 361.085 for a solid  
| waste facility other than a facility for the disposal of hazardous  
| waste. This subsection applies only to an owner or operator of a  
| recycling facility:  
|  (1) at which combustible material is stored outdoors;  
| or  
|  (2) that poses a significant risk to public health and  
| safety as determined by the commission.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 361.421, Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (5), (6) and (8) to read as follows:  
| SUBCHAPTER N. WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAMS; DISPOSAL FEES  
|  Sec. 361.421. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:  
|  (5) "Recyclable material" means material that has been  
| recovered or diverted from the solid waste stream for purposes of  
| reuse, recycling, or reclamation, a substantial portion of which is  
| consistently used in the manufacture of products which may  
| otherwise be produced using raw or virgin materials. Recyclable  
| material is not solid waste unless the material is deemed to be  
| hazardous solid waste by the Administrator of the United States  
| Environmental Protection Agency, whereupon it shall be regulated  
| accordingly unless it is otherwise exempted in whole or in part from  
| regulation under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended  
| by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C.  
| Section 6901 et seq.), by Environmental Protection Agency  
| regulation. However, recyclable material may become solid waste at  
| such time, if any, as it is abandoned or disposed of rather than  
| recycled, whereupon it will be solid waste with respect only to the  
| party actually abandoning or disposing of the material. _For_  
| _purposes of this subchapter, the term includes post-use polymers_  
| _and recoverable feedstocks provided the materials are converted_  
| _using pyrolysis or gasification into valuable raw, intermediate and_  
| _final products including, but not limited to plastic, monomers,_  
| _chemicals, waxes, lubricants, chemical feedstocks, crude oil,_  
| _diesel, gasoline, diesel and gasoline blendstocks, home heating_  
| _oil, and other fuels, including ethanol and transportation fuel._  
|  (6) "Recycled material" means materials, goods, or  
| products that consist of recyclable material or materials derived  
| from postconsumer waste, industrial waste, or hazardous waste which  
| may be used in place of a raw or virgin material in manufacturing a  
| new product. _When used in a pyrolysis or gasification process, the_  
| _term "recycled materials" includes post-use polymers and_  
| _recoverable feedstocks._  
|  (8) "Recycling" means a process by which materials  
| that have served their intended use or are scrapped, discarded,  
| used, surplus, or obsolete are collected, separated, or processed  
| and returned to use in the form of raw materials in the production  
| of new products. Recycling includes:  
|  (A) the composting process if the compost  
| material is put to beneficial reuse as defined by the commission;  
| and  
|  (B) the application to land, as organic  
| fertilizer, of processed sludge or biosolids from municipal  
| wastewater treatment plants and other organic matter resulting from  
| poultry, dairy, livestock, or other agricultural operations. _; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____the conversion of post-use polymers and_  
| _recoverable feedstocks using a pyrolysis or gasification process._  
|  SECTION 5. Subchapter N, Chapter 361, Health and Safety  
| Code, is amended by adding Subsection 361.430 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___361.430._ _____ALTERNATIVES AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES._  
| _(a) In developing and implementing the state solid waste_  
| _management strategies and plans, the commission and the controller_  
| _shall utilize the pollution prevention advisory committee as set_  
| _out in Section 361.0215 of the Health and Safety Code to promote_  
| _Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) and the development and use_  
| _of pyrolysis and gasification processes to divert recoverable_  
| _polymers and other materials away from landfills and toward_  
| _conversion into valuable raw, intermediate and final products_  
| _including, but not limited to plastic, monomers, chemicals, waxes,_  
| _lubricants, chemical feedstocks, crude oil, diesel, gasoline,_  
| _diesel and gasoline blendstocks, home heating oil, and other fuels,_  
| _including ethanol and transportation fuel, by reducing unnecessary_  
| _and inappropriate barriers to the siting, permitting and operation_  
| _of facilities utilizing such technologies._  
|  _(b) Definitions. In this Subsection:_  
|  _(1)_ _____Engineered Fuel._ _____The term "engineered fuel"_  
| _means a solid fuel that is manufactured from recoverable_  
| _constituents of municipal solid waste or other secondary materials._  
|  _(2)_ _____Feedstock._ _____The term "feedstock" means raw_  
| _material that is used in a machine or industrial process."_  
|  _(3)_ _____Sustainable Materials Management._ _____The term_  
| _"sustainable materials management" means a systematic approach to_  
| _using and reusing materials more productively over their entire_  
| _life cycle, taking into account life-cycle cost benefit analysis_  
| _considerations._  
|  _(c)_ _____Study._ _____With respect to post-use polymers and_  
| _recoverable feedstocks that are often deposited in landfills, the_  
| _commission shall conduct a study to: (a)_ ___evaluate recycling and_  
| _recovery based on the energy and water savings and greenhouse gas_  
| _reductions achieved by improving material recovery from the solid_  
| _waste stream, including by measuring certain environmental_  
| _benefits of waste prevention; and (b)_ ___determine the manner in which_  
| _the State and local government officials can promote and make_  
| _progress toward sustainable materials management and a_  
| _cost-effective system (including with respect to environmental_  
| _issues), through the use of pyrolysis, gasification, and other_  
| _innovative technologies such as engineered fuels, to convert_  
| _post-use polymers, alone or in combination with other recoverable_  
| _feedstocks, into materials that can be used as plastic, monomers,_  
| _chemicals and chemical feedstocks or to generate energy or fuels._  
|  _(d)_ _____Completion of Study._ _____Not later than 2 years after the_  
| _date of enactment of this Act, the commission and controller shall_  
| _complete the study described in subsection (c) and submit to the_  
| _Governor and General Assembly a report providing findings and_  
| _recommendations developed through the study."_  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect ________________

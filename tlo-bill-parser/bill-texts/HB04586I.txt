|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to certain academic programs and projects undertaken by  
| public institutions of higher education at an off-campus academic  
| or research site or a similar location.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 61.0512(a), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) A new degree or certificate program may be added at an  
| institution of higher education only with specific prior approval  
| of the board. _A degree or certificate program offered at an_  
| _off-campus academic or research site is considered a new degree or_  
| _certificate program if not previously offered at the off-campus_  
| _academic or research site._ A new degree or certificate program is  
| considered approved if the board has not completed a review under  
| this section and acted to approve or disapprove the proposed  
| program before the first anniversary of the date on which an  
| institution of higher education submits a completed application for  
| approval to the board. The board may not summarily disapprove a  
| program without completing the review required by this section.  
| The board shall specify by rule the elements that constitute a  
| completed application and shall make an administrative  
| determination of the completeness of the application not later than  
| the fifth business day after receiving the application. A request  
| for additional information in support of an application that has  
| been determined administratively complete does not toll the period  
| within which the application is considered approved under this  
| section.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 61.0572(d), Education Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (d) The board may review purchases of improved real property  
| added to an institution's educational and general buildings and  
| facilities inventory to determine whether the property meets the  
| standards adopted by the board for cost, efficiency, space need,  
| and space use, but _subject to Section 61.0584_ the purchase of the  
| improved real property is not contingent on board review _or_  
| _approval_.  Standards must be adopted by the board using the  
| negotiated rulemaking procedures under Chapter 2008, Government  
| Code.  If the property does not meet those standards, the board  
| shall notify the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of  
| the house of representatives, the governing board of the applicable  
| institution, and the Legislative Budget Board.  This subsection  
| does not impair the board's authority to collect data relating to  
| the improved real property that is added each year to the  
| educational and general buildings and facilities inventory of  
| institutions of higher education.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 61.058(b), Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) The board may review all construction, repair, or  
| rehabilitation of buildings and facilities at institutions of  
| higher education to determine whether the construction,  
| rehabilitation, or repair meets the standards adopted by board rule  
| for cost, efficiency, space need, and space use, but _subject to_  
| _Section 61.0584_ the construction, rehabilitation, or repair is not  
| contingent on board review _or approval_. Standards must be adopted  
| by the board using the negotiated rulemaking procedures under  
| Chapter 2008, Government Code.  If the construction,  
| rehabilitation, or repair does not meet those standards, the board  
| shall notify the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of  
| the house of representatives, the governing boards of the  
| applicable institutions, and the Legislative Budget Board.  This  
| subsection does not impair the board's authority to collect data  
| relating to the construction, repair, or rehabilitation of  
| buildings and facilities occurring each year at institutions of  
| higher education.  
|  SECTION 4. Subchapter C, Chapter 61, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 61.0584 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___61.0584._ _____OFF-CAMPUS ACADEMIC OR RESEARCH SITE. (a)_  
| _This section does not apply to buildings and facilities that are_  
| _located on an off-campus academic or research site, that are to be_  
| _used exclusively for auxiliary enterprises, and that will not_  
| _require appropriations from the legislature for operation,_  
| _maintenance, or repair._  
|  _(b)_ _____Based on criteria established under Subsection (d), the_  
| _board shall review and shall approve or disapprove an action taken_  
| _by the governing board of an institution of higher education or_  
| _university system, through purchase, lease, or otherwise, to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____acquire improved or unimproved real property for_  
| _use at a new or existing off-campus academic or research site; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____acquire or construct a building or facility for_  
| _use at a site described by Subdivision (1)._  
|  _(c)_ _____The board, using the negotiated rulemaking procedures_  
| _under Chapter 2008, Government Code, shall develop a procedure for_  
| _each institution of higher education or university system to use to_  
| _identify, for purposes of the board review required by this_  
| _section, the scope and character of projects that are proposed for:_  
|  _(1)_ _____an off-campus academic or research site, including_  
| _projects relating to:_  
|  _(A) a multi-institution teaching center (MITC);_  
|  _(B) a medical school;_  
|  _(C) a branch campus;_  
|  _(D) a satellite campus; and_  
|  _(E) a health science center; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____any other location that is separate from the main_  
| _campus of an institution and that is to be used for academic or_  
| _research purposes._  
|  _(d)_ _____Using the negotiated rulemaking procedures under_  
| _Chapter 2008, Government Code, the board shall establish criteria_  
| _for reviewing and for approving or disapproving an action taken by_  
| _the governing board of an institution of higher education or_  
| _university system as described by Subsection (b). Criteria adopted_  
| _under this subsection must prioritize the academic and research_  
| _needs of institutions of higher education while preventing_  
| _unnecessary duplication in program offerings, faculties, and_  
| _physical plants._  
|  _(e)_ _____Information related to the board's findings and_  
| _determinations under this section is not subject to the required_  
| _disclosure under Chapter 552, Government Code._  
|  _(f)_ _____The board may conduct a closed meeting pursuant to_  
| _Section 551.072, Government Code, to deliberate the approval or_  
| _disapproval of any action subject to that section and taken by the_  
| _governing board of an institution of higher education or university_  
| _system as described by Subsection (b). As necessary and_  
| _appropriate, the board may hold its closed meeting as an emergency_  
| _meeting under Section 551.045, Government Code._  
|  _(g)_ _____The board shall report its findings and determinations_  
| _under this section to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the_  
| _speaker of the house of representatives, the Legislative Budget_  
| _Board, and the governing boards of the applicable institutions of_  
| _higher education or university systems._  
|  SECTION 5. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board  
| shall adopt the rules required by Section 61.0584, Education Code,  
| as added by this Act, as soon as practicable following the effective  
| date of this Act, but not later than August 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 6. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a proposal for acquisition or construction made on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. A proposal for acquisition or  
| construction made before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the proposal was made, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to regulation of persons holding a certificate of  
| self-insurance for establishment of financial responsibility for  
| operating a motor vehicle.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 601.124, Transportation Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 601.124. SELF-INSURANCE. (a) A person in whose name  
| more than 25 motor vehicles are registered may qualify as a  
| self-insurer by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by  
| the _Texas Department of Insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] as provided by this  
| section.  
|  (b) The _Texas Department of Insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] may  
| issue a certificate of self-insurance to a person if:  
|  (1) the person applies for the certificate; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (2) _the person files with the Texas Department of_  
| _Insurance a bond:_  
|  _(A) in the amount of $10,000;_  
|  _(B) conditioned for payment:_  
|  _(i)_ _____in the amounts and under the same_  
| _circumstances as required under a motor vehicle liability insurance_  
| _policy; and_  
|  _(ii)_ _____in accordance with the claims review_  
| _procedure under Subsection (c-1) or a court order;_  
|  _(C)_ _____that is not cancelable before the sixth day_  
| _after the date the Texas Department of Insurance receives written_  
| _notice of the cancellation; and_  
|  _(D)_ _____approved by the Texas Department of_  
| _Insurance; and_  
|  _(3)_ the _commissioner of insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] is  
| satisfied that the person has and will continue to have the ability  
| to pay judgments obtained against the person.  
|  (c) The self-insurer must supplement the certificate with  
| an agreement that, for accidents occurring while the certificate is  
| in force, the self-insurer will pay the same judgments _within the_  
| _time and_ in the same amounts as an insurer would be obligated to pay  
| under an owner's motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued to  
| the self-insurer if such policy were issued. _The agreement may_  
| _include any other requirements that the commissioner of insurance_  
| _determines are appropriate for ensuring that the self-insurer pays_  
| _a legitimate claim timely._  
|  _(c-1)_ _____The commissioner of insurance by rule shall establish_  
| _a claims review procedure under which a claimant may file a motor_  
| _vehicle collision claim against the self-insurer with the Texas_  
| _Department of Insurance. If the claimant prevails, the claimant_  
| _may recover the awarded amount from the bond filed by the_  
| _self-insurer and the self-insurer shall replenish the bond as_  
| _necessary for the bond to be in the amount described by Subsection_  
| _(b)(2)(A). A claim under the procedure is a contested case under_  
| _Chapter 2001, Government Code._  
|  _(c-2)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a person may file suit_  
| _against the self-insurer by using the self-insurer's assumed name_  
| _stated on a certificate filed under Chapter 71, Business & Commerce _  
| _Code, for a cause of action:_  
|  _(1) provided by other law; and_  
|  _(2) arising from a motor vehicle collision:_  
|  _(A)_ _____occurring while the certificate is in effect;_  
| _and_  
|  _(B)_ _____in which a motor vehicle registered by the_  
| _self-insurer is involved._  
|  (d) The _Texas Department of Insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] for  
| cause _, including failure to pay a legitimate claim timely or_  
| _failure to comply with a requirement imposed by the commissioner of_  
| _insurance,_ may cancel a certificate of self-insurance after a  
| hearing.  Cause includes failure to pay a judgment before the 31st  
| day after the date the judgment becomes final.  
|  (e) A self-insurer must receive at least five days' notice  
| of a hearing held under Subsection (d).  The _Texas Department of_  
| _Insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] shall send notice of the hearing to the  
| self-insurer by:  
|  (1) first class mail; or  
|  (2) e-mail if the self-insurer has provided an e-mail  
| address to the _Texas Department of Insurance_ [ ~~department~~ ] and has  
| elected to receive notice electronically.  
|  _(f)_ _____The Texas Department of Insurance shall suspend a_  
| _certificate under Subsection (d) for six months if the self-insurer_  
| _fails to pay a legitimate claim timely. If the self-insurer_  
| _subsequently fails to pay a legitimate claim timely, the Texas_  
| _Department of Insurance shall cancel the certificate._  
|  _(g)_ _____The commissioner of insurance may adopt rules necessary_  
| _to implement this section._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 601.124, Transportation Code, as amended  
| by this Act, applies only to a certificate of self-insurance issued  
| on or after January 1, 2020. A certificate of self-insurance issued  
| before January 1, 2020, is governed by the law applicable to the  
| certificate immediately before the effective date of this Act, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

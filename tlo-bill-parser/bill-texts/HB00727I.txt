| relating to the use of public school counselors' work time.

|  SECTION 1. Section 33.006, Education Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g) to read as follows:

| _a school counselor to spend at least 80 percent of the school_  
| _counselor's total work time on duties that are components of a_  
| _counseling program developed under Section 33.005. For purposes of_  
| _this subsection, time spent in administering assessment_

| _district and made available on request during regular school hours_  
| _to district employees, parents of district students, and the_  
| _public._  
|  _(e)_ _____If the board of trustees of a school district determines_  
| _that, because of staffing needs in the district or at a school in_

| _the school counselor's total work time on duties that are_  
| _components of a counseling program developed under Section 33.005,_  
| _the policy adopted under Subsection (d) shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____include the reasons why the counselor needs to_  
| _spend less than 80 percent of the counselor's work time on duties_  
| _that are components of the counseling program;_  
|  _(2)_ _____list the duties the counselor is expected to_  
| _perform that are not components of the counseling program; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____set the percentage of work time that the counselor_  
| _is required to spend on components of the counseling program._  
|  _(f)_ _____A school district may not include a provision in an_  
| _employment contract with a school counselor under Chapter 21 that_  
| _conflicts with the policy required by Subsection (d) or, except as_  
| _provided by Subsection (g), has the effect of authorizing a school_  
| _principal or school district superintendent to require a school_  
| _counselor to generally perform duties that are not primarily_  
| _related to a counseling function._  
|  _(g)_ _____A school district to which Subsection (e) applies may_  
| _not include a provision in an employment contract under Chapter 21_  
| _with an affected school counselor that has the effect of requiring_  
| _the counselor to generally perform a duty that is not primarily_  
| _related to a counseling function unless the duty is specified in the_  
| _district's policy under Subsection (e)(2)._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 7.028(a), Education Code, is amended to

| 42, only as necessary to ensure:

| _on or before the date specified by the commissioner._ ___As part of_  
| _each monitoring review, the agency shall interview a percentage of_

| date the contract was executed, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  (c) Section 7.028(a), Education Code, as amended by this  
| Act, and Section 39.056(d-1), Education Code, as added by this Act,

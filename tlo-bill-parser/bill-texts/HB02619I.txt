| [ ~~PEACE~~ ] OFFICERS.  (a)  _This section applies only to a member who_  
| _participates in the law enforcement, custodial, and peace officer_  
| _supplemental retirement fund._  
|  _(a-1)_ A member who has at least 20 years of service credit as  
| a law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer is eligible
to  
| retire regardless of age and receive a standard service retirement  
| annuity in an amount and to be funded as provided by this section.  
|  (b) The standard service retirement annuity payable for at  
| least 20 years of service credit as a law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ]  
| custodial _, or peace_ officer is an amount computed on the basis of  
| the member's average monthly compensation for the 60 highest months  
| of compensation in the employee class, times the sum of the  
| percentage factor used in the computation of a standard service  
| retirement annuity under Section 814.105 plus .5 percent.  
|  (c) The standard combined service retirement annuity that  
| is payable under this section is based on retirement on or after the  
| attainment of the normal retirement age, which for purposes of this  
| section is the earlier of either the age of 57 or the age at which  
| the sum of the member's age and amount of service credit in the  
| employee class equals the number 80.  The annuity of a law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer who retires before  
| reaching the age of 57 under any eligibility criteria is  
| actuarially reduced by five percent for each year of difference  
| between the member's age at retirement and 57.  The actuarial  
| reduction described by this section is in addition to any other  
| actuarial reduction required by law.  
|  (c-1) A law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer  
| who retires before attaining the age of 50 is entitled only to an  
| annuity that is actuarially reduced from the annuity available at  
| the age of 50 to the law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_  
| officer whose service credit annuity amount is based on the sum of  
| the member's age and amount of law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _,
or_  
| _peace_ officer service credit and employee class service credit, and  
| is not entitled to have the annuity recalculated at normal  
| retirement age.  The standard or reduced annuity under this section  
| is payable from the trust fund established by Section 815.310 and  
| the law enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] custodial _, and peace_ officer  
| supplemental retirement fund in a ratio determined by the  
| retirement system.  
|  (d) A member who retires under this section retires  
| simultaneously from the employee class of membership. Optional  
| retirement annuities provided by Section 814.108 are available to a  
| member eligible to receive a service retirement annuity under this  
| section, but the same optional plan and beneficiary must be  
| selected for the portion of the annuity payable from the law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] custodial _, and peace_ officer supplemental  
| retirement fund and the portion payable from the trust fund  
| established by Section 815.310.  
|  (e) The amount payable from the law enforcement _,_ [ ~~and~~ ]  
| custodial _, and peace_ officer supplemental retirement fund is  
| reducible by the amount paid from the trust fund established by  
| Section 815.310 for service as a law enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial
_,_  
| _or peace_ officer.  The total combined amount of an annuity under  
| this section may not be less than the authorized benefit under  
| Subsection (b) subtracted by any amount necessary because of  
| selection of an optional annuity, because of retirement before the  
| normal retirement age, or as provided by Subsection (f).  
|  (f) The standard combined service retirement annuity  
| payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer may not exceed 100  
| percent of the average compensation computed under Subsection (b).  
|  (g) For purposes of this section, service as a law  
| enforcement _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] custodial _, or peace_ officer is creditable as  
| provided by rule of the board of trustees or on a month-to-month  
| basis, whichever is greater.

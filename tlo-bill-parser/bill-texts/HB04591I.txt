| adopted under this subsection is not subject to the performance  
| requirements established under Subsection (c) or Section 39.025.  
|  ~~[(c-3)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~In adopting a schedule for the administration of~~  
|  ~~assessment instruments under this section, the State Board of~~

|  ~~assessment instrument is administered at least two weeks later than~~

|  ~~under Subsection (a) during the 2006-2007 school year; and~~  
|  ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~the spring administration of end-of-course~~

|  ~~instruments in English I and English II must be permitted to occur~~  
|  ~~at an earlier date.]~~  
|  _(q)_ _____Notwithstanding any provision of this section or other_  
| _law, Texas is not required to comply with the Every Student Succeeds_

| perform satisfactorily on a previous administration of the

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to meeting the graduate medical education needs of medical  
| degree programs offered or proposed by public institutions of  
| higher education.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 61.05122, Education Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (d) and adding Subsections (b-1) and  
| (d-1) to read as follows:  
|  (b) As soon as practicable after an institution of higher  
| education completes preliminary planning for a new doctor of  
| medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) degree  
| program, the institution promptly shall provide to the board a  
| specific plan regarding the addition of first-year residency  
| positions for the graduate medical education program to be offered  
| in connection with the [ ~~new~~ ] degree program. The plan must propose  
| an increase in the number of those first-year residency positions  
| that, when combined with the total number of existing first-year  
| residency positions in this state, will be sufficient to reasonably  
| accommodate the number of anticipated graduates from all doctor of  
| medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) degree  
| programs that are offered in this state, including the degree  
| program proposed by the institution, and to provide adequate  
| opportunity for those graduates to remain in this state for the  
| clinical portion of their education.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____If in its preliminary planning the institution_  
| _establishes a long-term targeted maximum individual enrollment_  
| _class size that differs from its proposed initial maximum_  
| _individual enrollment class size, the institution's plan under_  
| _Subsection (b) must include a proposed increase in the number of_  
| _first-year residency positions over time that will be sufficient to_  
| _accommodate, in accordance with the requirements of that_  
| _subsection, the institution's planned increase or increases in_  
| _maximum individual enrollment class size._  
|  (d) An institution's projected increase in first-year  
| residency positions is presumed to be sufficient in its plan if _,_  
| _considering both the institution's proposed initial maximum_  
| _individual enrollment class size and any projected growth in that_  
| _class size,_ the increase will achieve the purposes of this section  
| with respect to all graduates from degree programs described by  
| this section that are offered or will be offered by the institution.  
|  _(d-1)_ _____Any institution that experiences substantial growth_  
| _in an individual enrollment class size after the approval of its_  
| _plan promptly shall provide to the board an updated plan that_  
| _complies with Subsection (b) based on the institution's actual_  
| _maximum individual enrollment class size and, if the institution_  
| _anticipates continued substantial growth, based on the_  
| _institution's targeted maximum individual enrollment class size._  
| _The board shall adopt rules that clearly define what constitutes a_  
| _substantial growth in class size for an institution subject to this_  
| _section._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

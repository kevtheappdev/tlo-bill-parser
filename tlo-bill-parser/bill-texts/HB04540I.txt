|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 16.0332(a), Election Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) After the registrar receives _notification_ [ ~~a list~~ ]  
| under Section 18.068 of this code or Section 62.113, Government  
| Code, of persons excused or disqualified from jury service because  
| of citizenship status _or who have indicated a lack of citizenship_  
| _status in connection with a motor vehicle record_ , the registrar  
| shall deliver to each registered voter whose name appears on the  
| list a written notice requiring the voter to submit to the registrar  
| proof of United States citizenship in the form of a certified copy  
| of the voter's birth certificate, United States passport, or  
| certificate of naturalization or any other form prescribed by the  
| secretary of state. The notice shall be delivered by forwardable  
| mail to the mailing address on the voter's registration application  
| and to any new address of the voter known to the registrar.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 18.068(a) and (b), Election Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The secretary of state shall quarterly compare the  
| information received under Section 16.001 of this code _,_ [ ~~and~~ ]  
| Section 62.113, Government Code, _and Section 730.005(9),_  
| _Transportation Code,_ to the statewide computerized voter

| appropriate by the secretary.  
|  (b) The secretary of state shall by rule determine what  
| information combinations identified as common to a voter and to an  
| individual _for whom the secretary of state has received information_  
| _under this section_ [ ~~who is deceased~~ ] constitute a weak match or a  
| strong match in order to:  
|  (1) produce the least possible impact on Texas voters;  
| and  
|  (2) fulfill its responsibility to manage the voter  
| rolls.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

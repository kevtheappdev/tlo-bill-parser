|  AN ACT  
| relating to electricity service provided by certain municipally  
| owned utilities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 32, Utilities Code, is amended by adding  
| Subchapter D to read as follows:  
| _SUBCHAPTER D. REVIEW OF RATES OF CERTAIN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES_  
|  _Sec._ ___32.151._ _____APPLICABILITY._ ___This subchapter applies only_  
| _to a municipally owned utility that:_  
|  _(1) owns generation assets; and_  
|  _(2) is not governed by an independent board._  
|  _Sec._ ___32.152._ _____REVIEW OF RATES; CUSTOMER CHOICE._ ___(a)_ __  
| _Notwithstanding any other law, a retail customer or group of_  
| _customers may file a petition for commission review of current or_  
| _proposed rates of a municipally owned utility that apply to the_  
| _petitioning customer or group if the customer or group:_  
|  _(1)_ _____has a non-demand metered total usage of more than_  
| _100,000 kilowatt hours per year; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____is served through a demand meter at secondary or_  
| _primary voltage._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission shall initiate a proceeding not later_  
| _than the 90th day after the petition is submitted to determine_  
| _whether the rates of the municipally owned utility are consistent_  
| _with the rates available to similarly situated customers in areas_  
| _of the state that have access to customer choice. If the commission_  
| _determines that the rates of the municipally owned utility are_  
| _consistent with the rates available to similarly situated customers_  
| _in areas of the state that have access to customer choice, the_  
| _commission shall deny the petition._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the commission does not deny the petition under_  
| _Subsection (b), not later than the 90th day after the date of the_  
| _determination described by Subsection (b), the municipally owned_  
| _utility shall file a rate application with the commission that_  
| _complies in all material respects with the rules and forms_  
| _prescribed by the commission._ ___The commission for good cause may_  
| _extend the deadline for filing the rate application._  
|  _(d)_ _____The commission shall conduct a full review of the rates_  
| _applicable to the petitioning customer or group to determine_  
| _whether those rates are just and reasonable using the standards_  
| _prescribed by Chapter 36, notwithstanding the lack of consistency_  
| _between those rates and rates available to similarly situated_  
| _customers in areas of the state that have access to customer choice._  
| _If the commission determines that the rates are just and_  
| _reasonable, the commission shall deny the petition. If the_  
| _commission determines that the rates are not just and reasonable,_  
| _the commission shall set rates for the petitioning customer or_  
| _group that are just, reasonable, and consistent with the rates_  
| _available to similarly situated customers in areas of the state_  
| _that have access to customer choice._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 301.001, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 301.001. TIME OF MEETING.  _(a) In each odd-numbered_  
| _year, the_ [ ~~The~~ ] legislature shall convene in regular session at 12  
| noon on the second Tuesday in January [ ~~of each odd-numbered year~~ ].  
|  _(b)_ _____In each even-numbered year, the legislature shall_  
| _convene in budget session at 12 noon on the third Tuesday in April._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 316.001, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 316.001. LIMIT. The rate of growth of appropriations  
| in a _state fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] from state tax revenues not  
| dedicated by the constitution may not exceed the estimated rate of  
| growth of the state's economy.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 316.002(a), (b), and (e), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) Before the Legislative Budget Board submits the budget  
| as prescribed by Section 322.008(c), the board shall establish:  
|  (1) the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy  
| from the current _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] to the next _fiscal year_  
| [ ~~biennium~~ ];  
|  (2) the level of appropriations for the current _fiscal_  
| _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] from state tax revenues not dedicated by the  
| constitution; and  
|  (3) the amount of state tax revenues not dedicated by  
| the constitution that could be appropriated for the next _fiscal_  
| _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] within the limit established by the estimated rate  
| of growth of the state's economy.  
|  (b) Except as provided by Subsection (c), the board shall  
| determine the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy by  
| dividing the estimated Texas total personal income for the next  
| _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] by the estimated Texas total personal income  
| for the current _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ]. Using standard statistical  
| methods, the board shall make the estimate by projecting through  
| the _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] the estimated Texas total personal  
| income reported by the United States Department of Commerce or its  
| successor in function.  
|  (e) In the absence of an action by the Legislative Budget  
| Board to adopt a spending limit as provided in Subsections (a) and  
| (b), the estimated rate of growth in the state's economy from the  
| current _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] to the next _fiscal year_ [
~~biennium~~ ]  
| shall be treated as if it were zero, and the amount of state tax  
| revenues not dedicated by the constitution that could be  
| appropriated within the limit established by the estimated rate of  
| growth in the state's economy shall be the same as the level of  
| appropriations for the current _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ].  
|  SECTION 4. Section 316.008(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) Unless the legislature adopts a resolution under  
| Article VIII, Section 22(b), of the Texas Constitution raising the  
| proposed limit on appropriations, the proposed limit is binding on  
| the legislature with respect to all appropriations for the next  
| _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] made from state tax revenues not dedicated  
| by the constitution.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 316.045, Government Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 316.045. REDUCTION IN CERTAIN AGENCY FEES. (a) Each  
| state agency that sets the fees charged by that agency in amounts  
| that are reasonable and necessary to cover the administrative costs  
| of the agency shall review the amounts charged as fees on _an annual_  
| [ ~~a biennial~~ ] basis. The agency shall review the fees before the  
| beginning of each state fiscal _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] and incorporate its  
| recommendations based on that review in its budget request  
| submitted to the Legislative Budget Board and the budget division  
| of the governor's office.  
|  (b) If the agency determines that the fees are set at a level  
| that exceeds the administrative costs of the agency as of the date  
| of the review, the agency shall reduce the amount of the affected  
| fees to the appropriate level and shall charge the reduced fees  
| during the subsequent _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ]. Each agency shall  
| give specific recognition to reductions in salary expenses  
| resulting from statutorily directed employee attrition.  
|  SECTION 6. Sections 316.092(b), (c), and (d), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) For the purposes of Section 49-g(c-2), Article III,  
| Texas Constitution, not later than December 1 of each  
| [ ~~even-numbered~~ ] year preceding the year in which this section  
| expires as provided by Subsection (e), the select committee shall  
| determine and adopt for the next state fiscal _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] a  
| sufficient balance of the fund in an amount that the committee  
| estimates will ensure an appropriate amount of revenue available in  
| the fund. In determining the sufficient balance for that fiscal  
| _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ], the committee shall consider:  
|  (1) the history of fund balances;  
|  (2) the history of transfers to the fund;  
|  (3) estimated fund balances during that fiscal _year_  
| [ ~~biennium~~ ];  
|  (4) estimated transfers to the fund to occur during  
| that fiscal _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ];  
|  (5) information available to the committee regarding  
| state highway congestion and funding demands; and  
|  (6) any other information requested by the committee  
| regarding the state's financial condition.  
|  (c) On or before October 1 of each [ ~~even-numbered~~ ] year  
| preceding the year in which this section expires as provided by  
| Subsection (e), the comptroller shall provide to the select  
| committee the comptroller's projection of the amounts to be  
| transferred to the fund during the next state fiscal _year_  
| [ ~~biennium~~ ].  
|  (d) When the select committee has adopted under Subsection  
| (b) the amount of the sufficient balance of the fund for a state  
| fiscal _year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ], the matter of approving that amount shall  
| be presented to each house of the legislature in a concurrent  
| resolution during the next succeeding [ ~~regular~~ ] legislative  
| session _, other than a special session of the legislature_. The  
| resolution must be presented for a vote in each house of the  
| legislature not later than the 30th day of that legislative  
| session, must be approved by a vote of a majority of the members of  
| each house, and must be finally approved by each house not later  
| than the 45th day of that legislative session. If a resolution  
| finally approved under this subsection is amended during the  
| legislative process to provide for a different sufficient balance  
| of the fund than that adopted under Subsection (b), that different  
| balance is the sufficient balance adopted under this section for  
| purposes of Section 316.093. If a resolution finally approved  
| under this subsection does not provide for a different sufficient  
| balance of the fund or if a resolution is not finally approved as  
| provided by this subsection, the sufficient balance adopted under  
| Subsection (b) is the sufficient balance adopted under this section  
| for purposes of Section 316.093.  
|  SECTION 7. Sections 316.093(c) and (e), Government Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) If under Section 316.092 a sufficient balance has not  
| been adopted for the comptroller to consider under this section,  
| the comptroller shall adjust the allocation of amounts to be  
| transferred to the fund and to the state highway fund provided by  
| Section 49-g(c), Article III, Texas Constitution, so that the total  
| of those amounts is transferred to the economic stabilization fund,  
| except that the comptroller shall reduce a transfer made under this  
| subsection as necessary to prevent the amount in the fund from  
| exceeding the limit in effect for that _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] under  
| Section 49-g(g) of that article.  
|  (e) For the purposes of Section 49-g(c-2), Article III,  
| Texas Constitution, the comptroller shall adjust the allocation  
| provided by Section 49-g(c-1) of that article of amounts to be  
| transferred to the fund and to the state highway fund under Section  
| 49-g(c) of that article in a state fiscal year beginning on or after  
| September 1, 2025, so that the total of those amounts is transferred  
| to the economic stabilization fund, except that the comptroller  
| shall reduce a transfer made under this subsection as necessary to  
| prevent the amount in the fund from exceeding the limit in effect  
| for that _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] under Section 49-g(g) of that  
| article.  
|  SECTION 8. Section 317.003(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The governor or Legislative Budget Board may make a  
| proposal at any time except during a [ ~~regular or special~~ ] session of

| been made for any specified fiscal year that has not ended at the  
| time the proposal is made.

| Code, are amended to read as follows:

| of the budget of estimated appropriations prepared by the director  
| to the governor and each member of the legislature.  
|  (d) Not later than the seventh day after a regular _or budget_  
| [ ~~legislative~~ ] session convenes, the director shall transmit a copy  
| of the general appropriations bill to the governor and each member  
| of the legislature.  
|  SECTION 10. Chapter 322, Government Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 322.021 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___322.021._ _____STUDY TO IMPLEMENT ANNUAL BUDGET. (a)_ ___The_

| _and administrative action necessary to implement an annual budget_  
| _as effectively as practicable._

| or the anticipated revenues of the next _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] for  
| the purpose of certification. The comptroller shall base the  
| reports, estimates, and certifications of available funds on the  
| actual or estimated cash condition of the treasury and shall  
| consider outstanding and undisbursed appropriations at the end of  
| each _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] as probable disbursements of the  
| succeeding _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] in the same manner that earned  
| but uncollected income of a current _fiscal year_ [ ~~biennium~~ ] is  
| considered in probable receipts of the succeeding _fiscal year_

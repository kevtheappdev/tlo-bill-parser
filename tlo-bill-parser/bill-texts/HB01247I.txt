|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to liability for the additional tax imposed on land  
| appraised for ad valorem tax purposes as agricultural land if the  
| use of the land changes as a result of a condemnation.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.46, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (g) to read as follows:  
|  _(g)_ _____If the additional taxes are due because the land has_  
| _been diverted to a nonagricultural use as a result of a_  
| _condemnation, the additional taxes and interest imposed by this_  
| _section are the personal obligation of the condemning entity and_  
| _not the property owner from whom the property was taken._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a change of use of land that occurs on or after the effective date  
| of this Act.  A change of use of land that occurred before the  
| effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the  
| change of use occurred, and the former law is continued in effect  
| for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

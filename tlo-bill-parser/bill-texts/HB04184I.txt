|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the exemption from ad valorem taxation of a percentage  
| of the appraised value of the residence homestead of a partially  
| disabled veteran and the amount of the exemption for the surviving  
| spouses and children of certain disabled veterans.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 11.22, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (b-1) and amending Subsections (c) and (e) to read as  
| follows:  
|  _(b-1)_ _____A disabled veteran who has a disability rating of at_  
| _least 10 percent but less than 100 percent is entitled to an_  
| _exemption from taxation of a percentage of the appraised value of_  
| _the disabled veteran's residence homestead equal to the disabled_  
| _veteran's disability rating._  
|  (c) If a disabled veteran who is entitled to an exemption by  
| Subsection (a) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (b) _, or (b-1)_ [ ~~of this section~~ ] dies,
the  
| veteran's surviving spouse is entitled to an exemption from  
| taxation of a portion of the assessed value of a property the spouse  
| owns and designates as provided by Subsection (f) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ].  The amount of the exemption is the _dollar_ amount of the  
| veteran's exemption at time of death.  The spouse is entitled to an  
| exemption by this subsection only for as long as the spouse remains  
| unmarried. If the spouse does not survive the veteran, each of the  
| veteran's surviving children who is younger than 18 years of age and  
| unmarried is entitled to an exemption from taxation of a portion of  
| the assessed value of a property the child owns and designates as  
| provided by Subsection (f) [ ~~of this section~~ ].  The amount of  
| exemption for each eligible child is computed by dividing the  
| _dollar_ amount of the veteran's exemption at time of death by the  
| number of eligible children.  _The surviving spouse or a surviving_  
| _child of a disabled veteran who was receiving an exemption under_  
| _Subsection (b-1) at the time of the veteran's death may designate as_  
| _provided by Subsection (f) only a property that qualifies as the_  
| _spouse's or child's residence homestead._  
|  (e) An individual who qualifies for more than one exemption  
| authorized by this section is entitled to aggregate the amounts of  
| the exemptions, except that:  
|  (1) a disabled veteran who qualifies for more than one  
| exemption authorized by Subsections (a) _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] (b) _, and (b-1)_ [
~~of~~  
|  ~~this section~~ ] is entitled to only one exemption but may choose the  
| greatest exemption for which _the veteran_ [ ~~he~~ ] qualifies; and  
|  (2) an individual who receives an exemption as a  
| surviving spouse of a disabled veteran as provided by Subsection  
| (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ] may not receive an exemption as a surviving  
| child as provided by Subsection (c) or (d) [ ~~of this section~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. Section 11.22(h), Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subdivision (3-a) to read as follows:  
|  _(3-a)_ _____"Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned_  
| _by Section 11.13._  
|  SECTION 3. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, proposing a constitutional amendment  
| authorizing the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation a  
| percentage of the assessed value of the residence homestead of a  
| partially disabled veteran based on the disability rating of the  
| veteran is approved by the voters.  If that constitutional  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

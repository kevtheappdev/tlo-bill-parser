|  _(b)_ _____After extraction activities at an aggregate production_  
| _operation have ceased and the operator has notified the commission_  
| _in writing that the operations have ceased, the requirements of_  
| _this subchapter are not applicable to the aggregate production_

|  _Sec._ ___135.0102._ _____SURVEY. (a) The commission annually shall_

| _an amount sufficient to maintain a registry of active aggregate_  
| _production operations in this state and implement this chapter, not_  
| _to exceed $1,000._  
|  _(c)_ _____Registration fees collected under this section shall be_  
| _deposited in the aggregate production operation regulation account_  
| _and may be used only to implement this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0104._ _____REGISTRATION PENALTY. The commission may_  
| _assess a penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000_

| _SUBCHAPTER D. RECLAMATION PERMIT_  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0151._ _____RECLAMATION OBJECTIVE. (a) The basic_

| _with the anticipated subsequent use of the affected land._  
|  _(b)_ _____The process of reclamation may require contouring,_  
| _terracing, grading, backfilling, resoiling, revegetation,_  
| _compaction and stabilization and settling ponds, water_  
| _impoundments, diversion ditches, and other water treatment_  
| _facilities in order to minimize water diminution to existing water_  
| _sources, pollution, soil and wind erosion, or flooding resulting_  
| _from extraction or any other activity that may be considered_  
| _necessary to accomplish the reclamation of the affected land to a_  
| _substantially beneficial condition._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0152._ _____RECLAMATION PERMIT REQUIRED. (a) A person_  
| _may not conduct an aggregate production operation without first_  
| _obtaining a reclamation permit for that operation from the_  
| _commission under this subchapter._  
|  _(b)_ _____The commission by rule shall establish requirements for_  
| _obtaining a permit. The requirements must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____ensure that the permit holder is capable of_  
| _completing a reclamation process for the permit area in a manner_  
| _that is compatible with the objective described by Section_  
| _135.0151; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____be modeled on the reclamation requirements for_  
| _surface mining of uranium and uranium ore under Chapter 131 and_  
| _surface coal mining under Chapter 134, including the submission of_  
| _a reclamation plan and a performance bond._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0153._ _____PERMIT APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE. (a) The_  
| _commission by rule shall establish requirements for submitting a_  
| _permit application._

| _that the application complies with this subchapter and rules_  
| _adopted under this chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0154._ _____PERMIT REVISIONS. (a) The commission by_  
| _rule shall require that a permit holder:_  
|  _(1)_ _____notify the commission of any significant changes_

|  _(2)_ _____apply for a permit revision if the commission_  
| _determines a revision is appropriate._  
|  _(b)_ _____A permit revision application is subject to the same_  
| _requirements for issuance as an initial permit._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0155._ _____CIVIL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT._  
| _Subchapter H, Chapter 134, applies to the civil or administrative_  
| _enforcement of this subchapter or a rule, order, or permit adopted_  
| _or issued under this subchapter in the same manner as Subchapter H,_  
| _Chapter 134, applies to the civil or administrative enforcement of_  
| _that chapter or a rule, order, or permit adopted or issued under_  
| _that chapter._  
|  _Sec._ ___135.0156._ _____CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR WILFUL AND KNOWING_

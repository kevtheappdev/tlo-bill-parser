| _subject to a claim adverse to the county or a lien on or encumbrance_  
| _against property of the county._ ___Toll revenues that are the property_  
| _of the county_ ___are not subject to a claim adverse to any other entity_

| _any payment as required by the tolling services agreement._ ___A_  
| _county's written commitment to fully or partially fund a cash_

| _cash collateral account under this subsection._  
|  _(i)_ _____For purposes of toll collection and enforcement, a toll_

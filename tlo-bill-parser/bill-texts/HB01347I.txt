|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the Texas Sovereignty Act.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) This Act may be cited as the Texas  
| Sovereignty Act.  
|  (b) The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) The people of the several states forming the  
| United States of America created the federal government to be their  
| agent for certain enumerated powers delegated by the states and the  
| people to the federal government through the United States  
| Constitution.  
|  (2) The Tenth Amendment to the United States  
| Constitution confirms the intent and understanding of the people of  
| the United States that all powers not delegated to the United States  
| by the Constitution, or prohibited by it to the states, are reserved  
| to the states respectively, or to the people.  
|  (3) Each power delegated to the federal government by  
| the United States Constitution is constitutionally limited to that  
| power as it was understood and exercised at the time it was  
| delegated.  An amendment to the Constitution as ratified by the  
| states is required to expand or limit a constitutionally delegated  
| power.  
|  (4) The United States Constitution authorizes the  
| United States Congress to exercise only those specific powers  
| enumerated in Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, and  
| those other powers as may be delegated to Congress through  
| amendments to the Constitution as ratified by the states.  
|  (5) Article VI, United States Constitution, makes  
| supreme the Constitution and federal laws enacted pursuant to the  
| Constitution, further requiring that public officials at all levels  
| and in all branches of government support the Constitution.  
|  (6) The power delegated to the United States Congress  
| to regulate commerce among the several states under Section 8,  
| Article I, United States Constitution, is limited to federal  
| regulation of actual commerce between the states and among foreign  
| nations. Regulation of intrastate commerce is reserved to the  
| states and to the people of the states. The Commerce Clause of the  
| Constitution constrains the legislative, executive, and judicial  
| branches of the federal government.  
|  (7) The power delegated to the United States Congress  
| to make all necessary and proper federal laws under Section 8,  
| Article I, United States Constitution, allows Congress to enact  
| only those laws necessary and proper to execute the  
| constitutionally delegated powers vested in the federal  
| government, all other powers being reserved to the states and to the  
| people of the states.  
|  (8) The power delegated to the United States Congress  
| to provide for the general welfare of the United States under  
| Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, in the General  
| Welfare Clause constitutionally constrains Congress when  
| exercising a delegated power to act in a manner that serves the  
| states and the people of the states well and uniformly.  
|  (9) Sections 1 and 2, Article I, Texas Constitution,  
| provide that this state and the people of this state retain the  
| sovereign power to regulate the affairs of Texas, subject only to  
| the United States Constitution.  
|  (c) The federal government does not have the power to take  
| any legislative, executive, or judicial action that violates the  
| United States Constitution.  
|  (d) The contract with the State of Texas has been willfully  
| violated by the federal government and must be constitutionally  
| restored.  
|  (e) This Act calls on all officials in federal, state, and  
| local government, in all branches and at all levels, to honor their  
| oaths to preserve, protect, and defend the United States  
| Constitution and its ratified amendments against any federal action  
| that:  
|  (1) would unconstitutionally undermine, diminish, or  
| disregard the balance of powers between the sovereign states and  
| the federal government established by the United States  
| Constitution and its ratified amendments; or  
|  (2) is outside the scope of the power delegated to the  
| federal government by the United States Constitution.

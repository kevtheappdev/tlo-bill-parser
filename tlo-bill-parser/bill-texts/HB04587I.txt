| relating to optional annuity increases for certain retirees and  
| beneficiaries of the Texas Municipal Retirement System and related  
| distribution requirements.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 853.404, Government Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (c) and adding Subsection (f) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) The governing body of a participating municipality that  
| adopts an ordinance under Section 854.203 providing for increased  
| annuities effective January 1 of a designated year may further  
| provide in the ordinance that increases in annuities will be  
| credited effective January 1 of each year following the designated  
| year based on recomputations made as provided by Section _854.203(b)_  
| [ ~~854.203(b)(1)~~ ] for each year following the initial computation,  
| and using the fraction specified in the ordinance as required under  
| Section _854.203(b)_ [ ~~854.203(b)(2)~~ ] in the recomputations.  
|  _(f)_ _____If an ordinance described by Subsection (c) will cease_  
| _to be in effect for a future year, or if an increase in annuities_  
| _specified in an ordinance described by Subsection (c) will be_  
| _changed or discontinued as provided by this section, the governing_  
| _body of the participating municipality shall notify members and_  
| _annuitants by regular mail not later than the 60th day before the_  
| _date on which the ordinance will cease to be in effect or the_  
| _increase will be changed or discontinued. For an annuitant who_  
| _receives a periodic check or advice of deposit from the retirement_  
| _system by regular mail, the notice required by this subsection must_  
| _be included with the annuitant's check or advice of deposit._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 854.203, Government Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsections (b) and (f) and adding Subsection (b-1) to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) The amount of annuity increase under this section is  
| computed _by one of the following methods:_  
|  _(1)_ as the sum of the prior and current service  
| annuities on the effective date of retirement of the person on whose  
| service the annuities are based, multiplied by:  
|  _(A)_ [ ~~(1)~~ ] the percentage change in the Consumer  
| Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of  
| Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, from  
| December of the year immediately preceding the effective date of  
| the person's retirement to the December that is 13 months before the  
| effective date of the ordinance providing the increase; and  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~(2)~~ ] 30 percent, 50 percent, or 70 percent,  
| as specified by the governing body in the ordinance, except that if  
| the governing body has specified a different percentage in an  
| ordinance adopted under Section 853.404(c) and in effect on  
| December 31, 1999, the percentage used in computing annuity  
| increases for retirees of that municipality remains in effect until  
| changed or discontinued under Section 853.404 _; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____as the sum of the prior and current service_  
| _annuities of the person on whose service the annuities are based on_  
| _the effective date of the annuity increase multiplied by the_  
| _percentage increase specified in the ordinance adopted by the_  
| _governing body, except that an adjustment to an annuity after the_  
| _annuity starting date for an increase under this subdivision may_  
| _not cause an annuitant's annuity to exceed the amount to which the_  
| _annuitant would have been entitled to had the maximum amount of the_  
| _increase allowed under Subdivision (1) been applied to the_  
| _annuitant's annuity_.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____An increase under Subsection (b)(2) applies to all_  
| _annuities for which the effective date of retirement of the person_  
| _on whose service the annuity is based is at least 12 months before_  
| _the effective date of the increase._ ___Notwithstanding any other_  
| _provision of this subtitle, each distribution of a benefit under_  
| _this subtitle must be determined and made in accordance with_  
| _Section 401(a)(9), Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The board of_  
| _trustees may adopt rules it considers necessary to comply with the_  
| _distribution requirements._  
|  (f) _An increase granted to an annuitant under Subsection_  
| _(b)(2), or the_ [ ~~The~~ ] amount by which an increase under _Subsection_  
| _(b)(1)_ [ ~~this section~~ ] exceeds all previously granted increases to  
| an annuitant _,_ is _:_  
|  _(1)_ payable as a prior service annuity _;_  
|  _(2)_ [ ~~, is~~ ] an obligation of the municipality's account  
| in the benefit accumulation fund _;_ [ ~~,~~ ] and  
|  _(3)_ [ ~~is~~ ] subject to reduction under Section  
| 855.308(f).

| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this

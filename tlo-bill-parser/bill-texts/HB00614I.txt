|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the additional tax imposed on land appraised for ad  
| valorem tax purposes as agricultural, open-space, or timber land if  
| the land is sold or diverted to a different use.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 23.46(c) and (d), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) If land that has been designated for agricultural use in  
| any year is sold or diverted to a nonagricultural use, the total  
| amount of additional taxes for the three years preceding the year in  
| which the land is sold or diverted [ ~~plus interest at the rate~~  
|  ~~provided for delinquent taxes~~ ] becomes due.  Subject to Subsection  
| (f), a determination that the land has been diverted to a  
| nonagricultural use is made by the chief appraiser.  For purposes of  
| this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider any period  
| during which land is owned by the state in determining whether the  
| land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  The chief  
| appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner  
| of the land as soon as possible after making the determination and  
| shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to  
| protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely  
| protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the  
| additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall  
| prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes [ ~~plus interest~~ ]  
| as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs.  If the  
| additional taxes are due because of a sale of the land, the assessor  
| for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver the bill as soon as  
| practicable after the sale occurs.  The taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] are due  
| and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided  
| by law for _other delinquent_ ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing  
| unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days  
| after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the land.  
|  (d) A tax lien attaches to the land on the date the sale or  
| change of use occurs to secure payment of the additional tax [ ~~and~~  
|  ~~interest~~ ] imposed by Subsection (c) [ ~~of this section~~ ] and any  
| penalties _and interest_ incurred _if the tax becomes delinquent_. The  
| lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional  
| tax is imposed.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 23.47(c) and (d), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) A provision in an instrument pertaining to a loan  
| secured by a lien in favor of the lender on land appraised according  
| to this subchapter that requires the borrower to make a payment to  
| protect the lender from loss because of the imposition of  
| additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] under Section 23.46 is void unless  
| the provision:  
|  (1) requires the borrower to pay into an escrow  
| account established by the lender an amount equal to the additional  
| taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would be due under Section 23.46 if a sale  
| or change of use occurred on January 1 of the year in which the loan  
| is granted or amended;  
|  (2) requires the escrow account to bear interest to be  
| credited to the account monthly;  
|  (3) permits the lender to apply money in the escrow  
| account to the payment of a bill for additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ]  
| under Section 23.46 before the loan is paid and requires the lender  
| to refund the balance remaining in the escrow account after the bill  
| is paid to the borrower; and  
|  (4) requires the lender to refund the money in the  
| escrow account to the borrower on the payment of the loan.  
|  (d) On the request of the borrower or the borrower's  
| representative, the assessor for each taxing unit shall compute the  
| additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would be due that taxing unit  
| under Section 23.46 if a sale or change of use occurred on January 1  
| of the year in which the loan is granted or amended. The assessor  
| may charge a reasonable fee not to exceed the actual cost of making  
| the computation.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 23.55(a), (b), (e), (f), (m), and (n),  
| Tax Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by  
| this subchapter changes, an additional tax is imposed on the land  
| equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the land for  
| each of the _three_ [ ~~five~~ ] years preceding the year in which the  
| change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this  
| subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the land  
| been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years[ ~~,~~  
|  ~~plus interest at an annual rate of seven percent calculated from the~~  
|  ~~dates on which the differences would have become due~~ ]. For purposes  
| of this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider any period  
| during which land is owned by the state in determining whether a  
| change in the use of the land has occurred.  
|  (b) A tax lien attaches to the land on the date the change of  
| use occurs to secure payment of the additional tax [ ~~and interest~~ ]  
| imposed by this section and any penalties _and interest_ incurred _if_  
| _the tax becomes delinquent_. The lien exists in favor of all taxing  
| units for which the additional tax is imposed.  
|  (e) Subject to Section 23.551, a determination that a change  
| in use of the land has occurred is made by the chief appraiser.  The  
| chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the  
| owner of the land as soon as possible after making the determination  
| and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right  
| to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely  
| protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the  
| additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall  
| prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes [ ~~plus interest~~ ]  
| as soon as practicable.  The taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] are due and become  
| delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for  
| ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the  
| next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is  
| delivered to the owner of the land.  
|  (f) The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) [ ~~of this~~  
|  ~~section~~ ] do not apply if the change of use occurs as a result of:  
|  (1) a sale for right-of-way;  
|  (2) a condemnation;  
|  (3) a transfer of the property to the state or a  
| political subdivision of the state to be used for a public purpose;  
| or  
|  (4) a transfer of the property from the state, a  
| political subdivision of the state, or a nonprofit corporation  
| created by a municipality with a population of more than one million  
| under the Development Corporation Act (Subtitle C1, Title 12, Local  
| Government Code) to an individual or a business entity for purposes  
| of economic development if the comptroller determines that the  
| economic development is likely to generate for deposit in the  
| general revenue fund during the next two fiscal bienniums an amount  
| of taxes and other revenues that equals or exceeds 20 times the  
| amount of additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would have been  
| imposed under Subsection (a) had the sanctions provided by that  
| subsection applied to the transfer.  
|  (m) For purposes of determining whether a transfer of land  
| qualifies for the exemption from additional taxes provided by  
| Subsection (f)(4), on an application of the entity transferring or  
| proposing to transfer the land or of the individual or entity to  
| which the land is transferred or proposed to be transferred, the  
| comptroller shall determine the amount of taxes and other revenues  
| likely to be generated as a result of the economic development for  
| deposit in the general revenue fund during the next two fiscal  
| bienniums. If the comptroller determines that the amount of those  
| revenues is likely to equal or exceed 20 times the amount of  
| additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would be imposed under  
| Subsection (a) if the sanctions provided by that subsection applied  
| to the transfer, the comptroller shall issue a letter to the  
| applicant stating the comptroller's determination and shall send a  
| copy of the letter by regular mail to the chief appraiser.  
|  (n) Within one year of the conclusion of the two fiscal  
| bienniums for which the comptroller issued a letter as provided  
| under Subsection (m), the board of directors of the appraisal  
| district, by official board action, may direct the chief appraiser  
| to request the comptroller to determine if the amount of revenues  
| was equal to or exceeded 20 times the amount of taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ]  
| that would have been imposed under Subsection (a). The comptroller  
| shall issue a finding as to whether the amount of revenue met the  
| projected increases. The chief appraiser shall review the results  
| of the comptroller's finding and shall make a determination as to  
| whether sanctions under Subsection (a) should be imposed. If the  
| chief appraiser determines that the sanctions provided by  
| Subsection (a) shall be imposed, the sanctions shall be based on the  
| date of the transfer of the property under Subsection (f)(4).  
|  SECTION 4. Sections 23.58(c) and (d), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (c) A provision in an instrument pertaining to a loan  
| secured by a lien in favor of the lender on land appraised according  
| to this subchapter that requires the borrower to make a payment to  
| protect the lender from loss because of the imposition of  
| additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] under Section 23.55 is void unless  
| the provision:  
|  (1) requires the borrower to pay into an escrow  
| account established by the lender an amount equal to the additional  
| taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would be due under Section 23.55 if a  
| change of use occurred on January 1 of the year in which the loan is  
| granted or amended;  
|  (2) requires the escrow account to bear interest to be  
| credited to the account monthly;  
|  (3) permits the lender to apply money in the escrow  
| account to the payment of a bill for additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ]  
| under Section 23.55 before the loan is paid and requires the lender  
| to refund the balance remaining in the escrow account after the bill  
| is paid to the borrower; and  
|  (4) requires the lender to refund the money in the  
| escrow account to the borrower on the payment of the loan.  
|  (d) On the request of the borrower or the borrower's  
| representative, the assessor for each taxing unit shall compute the  
| additional taxes [ ~~and interest~~ ] that would be due that taxing unit  
| under Section 23.55 if a change of use occurred on January 1 of the  
| year in which the loan is granted or amended. The assessor may  
| charge a reasonable fee not to exceed the actual cost of making the  
| computation.

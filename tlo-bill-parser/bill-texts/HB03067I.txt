| _gas drilling, completion, flowback, or production._  
|  _(3)_ _____"Producer" has the meaning assigned by Section_

| _applicable, in the amount and under the conditions and limitations_  
| _provided by this chapter if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the producer provides to a permit holder produced_  
| _water that has a total dissolved solids concentration of more than_  
| _90,000 milligrams per liter;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the permit holder recycles the produced water so_  
| _that the water may be discharged into or adjacent to water in the_  
| _state or sold, regardless of whether the water is actually_

| _permit requirements for recycling the produced water; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the resulting fresh water meets standards for_  
| _discharge into water in the state under the federal National_  
| _Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program and the permit_  
| _holder complies with any state or federal requirements for testing_  
| _and reporting the quality of the water before discharge._  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as provided by Section 207.0003, the total amount_

| _holder during the reporting period that is subsequently recycled_  
| _during that period;_

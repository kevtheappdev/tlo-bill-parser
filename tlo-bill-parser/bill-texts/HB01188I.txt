|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the appraisal of land for ad valorem tax purposes as  
| qualified open-space land following a transfer between family  
| members.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.54, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (e-1) to read as follows:  
|  _(e-1)_ _____Notwithstanding Subsection (e), land remains eligible_  
| _for appraisal under this subchapter after a change in ownership of_  
| _the land occurs if the change in ownership results from a transfer_  
| _of the land from the former owner to a person who is related to the_  
| _former owner within the second degree by affinity or third degree by_  
| _consanguinity, as determined under Subchapter B, Chapter 573,_  
| _Government Code. A person described by this subsection must notify_  
| _the appraisal office of the transfer in writing within 180 days of_  
| _the date of the transfer._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 25.25, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsections (d-1), (d-2), and (d-3) and amending Subsections (e)  
| and (m) to read as follows:  
|  _(d-1)_ _____The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief_  
| _appraiser or of the property owner, may direct by written order_  
| _changes in the appraisal roll as provided by this subsection. The_  
| _board may order the appraised value of the owner's land in either of_  
| _the two preceding tax years to be changed to the value at which the_  
| _land would have been appraised under Subchapter D, Chapter 23, if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the chief appraiser or the property owner_  
| _demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the land was_  
| _appraised under Subchapter D, Chapter 23, for three of the five_  
| _preceding tax years;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the land was determined to be ineligible for_  
| _appraisal under Subchapter D, Chapter 23, for the applicable tax_  
| _year or years for which the change in appraised value is sought_  
| _because the property owner failed to file a new application for_  
| _appraisal under that subchapter after a change in ownership of the_  
| _land occurred;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the change in ownership was the result of a_  
| _transfer of the land from a person to whom the property owner is_  
| _related within the second degree by affinity or third degree by_  
| _consanguinity, as determined under Subchapter B, Chapter 573,_  
| _Government Code; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____the land continued to be used in a manner that_  
| _otherwise qualified the land for appraisal under Subchapter D,_  
| _Chapter 23, during the applicable tax year._  
|  _(d-2)_ _____If an appraisal roll is changed under Subsection_  
| _(d-1), the property owner must pay to each affected taxing unit a_  
| _penalty equal to 10 percent of the difference between the amount of_  
| _tax imposed on the land and the amount of tax that would have been_  
| _imposed had the land been taxed at market value. Payment of the_  
| _penalty is secured by the lien that attaches to the land under_  
| _Section 32.01 and is subject to enforced collection under Chapter_  
| _33._  
|  _(d-3)_ _____An appraisal roll may not be changed under Subsection_  
| _(d-1) if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the land was the subject of a protest brought by_  
| _the property owner under Chapter 41, a hearing on the protest was_  
| _conducted in which the property owner offered evidence or argument,_  
| _and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest_  
| _on the merits; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____the appraised value of the land was established as_  
| _a result of a written agreement between the property owner or the_  
| _owner's agent and the appraisal district._  
|  (e) If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not  
| agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the  
| motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c) _,_  
| [ ~~or~~ ] (d) _, or (d-1)_ is entitled on request to a hearing on and a  
| determination of the motion by the appraisal review board. A party  
| bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or  
| errors that the motion is seeking to correct _under Subsection (c) or_  
| _(d) or state the grounds for the change in appraised value sought_  
| _under Subsection (d-1)_. Not later than 15 days before the date of  
| the hearing, the board shall deliver written notice of the date,  
| time, and place of the hearing to the chief appraiser, the property  
| owner, and the presiding officer of the governing body of each  
| taxing unit in which the property is located. The chief appraiser,  
| the property owner, and each taxing unit are entitled to present  
| evidence and argument at the hearing and to receive written notice  
| of the board's determination of the motion.  The property owner is  
| entitled to elect to present the owner's evidence and argument  
| before, after, or between the cases presented by the chief  
| appraiser and each taxing unit.  A property owner who files the  
| motion must comply with the payment requirements of Section 25.26  
| or forfeit the right to a final determination of the motion.  
|  (m) The hearing on a motion under Subsection (c) _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] (d) _,_

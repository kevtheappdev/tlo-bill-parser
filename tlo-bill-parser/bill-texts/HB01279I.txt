|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to jury instructions regarding parole eligibility.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 4(a), (b), and (c), Article 37.07, Code  
| of Criminal Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In the penalty phase of the trial of a felony case in  
| which the punishment is to be assessed by the jury rather than the  
| court, if the offense of which the jury has found the defendant  
| guilty is an offense under Section 71.02, Penal Code, other than an  
| offense punishable as a state jail felony under that section, an  
| offense under Section 71.023, Penal Code, or an offense listed in  
| Article 42A.054(a), or if the judgment contains an affirmative  
| finding under Article 42A.054(c) or (d), unless the defendant has  
| been convicted of an offense under Section 21.02, Penal Code, an  
| offense under Section 22.021, Penal Code, that is punishable under  
| Subsection (f) of that section, or a capital felony, the court shall  
| charge the jury in writing as follows:  
|  [ ~~"Under the law applicable in this case, the defendant, if~~  
|  ~~sentenced to a term of imprisonment, may earn time off the period of~~  
|  ~~incarceration imposed through the award of good conduct~~  
|  ~~time.~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~Prison authorities may award good conduct time to a
prisoner~~  
|  ~~who exhibits good behavior, diligence in carrying out prison work~~  
|  ~~assignments, and attempts at rehabilitation.~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~If a
prisoner~~  
|  ~~engages in misconduct, prison authorities may also take away all or~~  
|  ~~part of any good conduct time earned by the prisoner.~~ ]  
|  " _The_ [ ~~It is also possible that the~~ ] length of time for which _a_  
| [ ~~the~~ ] defendant _is_ [ ~~will be~~ ] imprisoned _may_ [ ~~might~~ ] be
reduced by  
| the award of parole.  
|  "Under the law applicable in this case, if the defendant is  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the defendant will not become  
| eligible for parole until the actual time served equals one-half of  
| the sentence imposed or 30 years, whichever is less[ ~~, without~~  
|  ~~consideration of any good conduct time the defendant may earn~~ ].  If  
| the defendant is sentenced to a term of less than four years, the  
| defendant must serve at least two years before the defendant is  
| eligible for parole.  Eligibility for parole does not guarantee  
| that parole will be granted.  
|  "It cannot accurately be predicted how the parole law [ ~~and~~  
|  ~~good conduct time~~ ] might be applied to this defendant if sentenced  
| to a term of imprisonment, because the application of _that law_  
| [ ~~these laws~~ ] will depend on decisions made by [ ~~prison and~~ ]
parole  
| authorities.  
|  "You may consider the existence of the parole law [ ~~and good~~  
|  ~~conduct time.~~ ~~~~ ~~However, you are not to consider the extent to
which~~  
|  ~~good conduct time may be awarded to or forfeited by this particular~~  
|  ~~defendant~~ ].  You are not to consider the manner in which the parole  
| law may be applied to this particular defendant."  
|  (b) In the penalty phase of the trial of a felony case in  
| which the punishment is to be assessed by the jury rather than the  
| court, if the offense is punishable as a felony of the first degree,  
| if a prior conviction has been alleged for enhancement of  
| punishment as provided by Section 12.42(b), (c)(1) or (2), or (d),  
| Penal Code, or if the offense is a felony not designated as a  
| capital felony or a felony of the first, second, or third degree and  
| the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for the offense  
| is longer than 60 years, unless the offense of which the jury has  
| found the defendant guilty is an offense that is punishable under  
| Section 21.02(h), Penal Code, or is listed in Article 42A.054(a) or  
| the judgment contains an affirmative finding under Article  
| 42A.054(c) or (d), the court shall charge the jury in writing as  
| follows:  
|  _"The length of time for which a defendant is imprisoned may be_  
| _reduced by the award of parole._  
|  "Under the law applicable in this case, the defendant, if  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, may earn _early parole_  
| _eligibility_ [ ~~time off the period of incarceration imposed~~ ] through  
| the award of good conduct time.  Prison authorities may award good  
| conduct time to a prisoner who exhibits good behavior, diligence in  
| carrying out prison work assignments, and attempts at  
| rehabilitation.  If a prisoner engages in misconduct, prison  
| authorities may also take away all or part of any good conduct time  
| earned by the prisoner.  
|  [ ~~"It is also possible that the length of time for which the~~  
|  ~~defendant will be imprisoned might be reduced by the award of~~  
|  ~~parole.~~ ]  
|  "Under the law applicable in this case, if the defendant is  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, _the defendant_ [ ~~he~~ ] will not  
| become eligible for parole until the actual time served plus any  
| good conduct time earned equals one-fourth of the sentence imposed  
| or 15 years, whichever is less.  Eligibility for parole does not  
| guarantee that parole will be granted.  
|  "It cannot accurately be predicted how the parole law and  
| good conduct time might be applied to this defendant if [ ~~he is~~ ]  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, because the application of  
| these laws will depend on decisions made by prison and parole  
| authorities.  
|  "You may consider the existence of the parole law and good  
| conduct time.  However, you are not to consider the extent to which  
| good conduct time may be awarded to or forfeited by this particular  
| defendant.  You are not to consider the manner in which the parole  
| law may be applied to this particular defendant."  
|  (c) In the penalty phase of the trial of a felony case in  
| which the punishment is to be assessed by the jury rather than the  
| court, if the offense is punishable as a felony of the second or  
| third degree, if a prior conviction has been alleged for  
| enhancement as provided by Section 12.42(a), Penal Code, or if the  
| offense is a felony not designated as a capital felony or a felony  
| of the first, second, or third degree and the maximum term of  
| imprisonment that may be imposed for the offense is 60 years or  
| less, unless the offense of which the jury has found the defendant  
| guilty is listed in Article 42A.054(a) or the judgment contains an  
| affirmative finding under Article 42A.054(c) or (d), the court  
| shall charge the jury in writing as follows:  
|  _"The length of time for which a defendant is imprisoned may be_  
| _reduced by the award of parole._  
|  "Under the law applicable in this case, the defendant, if  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, may earn _early parole_  
| _eligibility_ [ ~~time off the period of incarceration imposed~~ ] through  
| the award of good conduct time.  Prison authorities may award good  
| conduct time to a prisoner who exhibits good behavior, diligence in  
| carrying out prison work assignments, and attempts at  
| rehabilitation.  If a prisoner engages in misconduct, prison  
| authorities may also take away all or part of any good conduct time  
| earned by the prisoner.  
|  [ ~~"It is also possible that the length of time for which the~~  
|  ~~defendant will be imprisoned might be reduced by the award of~~  
|  ~~parole.~~ ]  
|  "Under the law applicable in this case, if the defendant is  
| sentenced to a term of imprisonment, _the defendant_ [ ~~he~~ ] will not  
| become eligible for parole until the actual time served plus any  
| good conduct time earned equals one-fourth of the sentence imposed.  
| Eligibility for parole does not guarantee that parole will be  
| granted.  
|  "It cannot accurately be predicted how the parole law and  
| good conduct time might be applied to this defendant if [ ~~he is~~ ]

| good conduct time may be awarded to or forfeited by this particular  
| defendant.  You are not to consider the manner in which the parole  
| law may be applied to this particular defendant."  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies to a  
| defendant sentenced for an offense on or after the effective date of  
| this Act, regardless of when the offense was committed.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to ensuring the safety of children in suits affecting the  
| parent-child relationship.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 153.001, Family Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (a) and adding Subsection (c) to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) The public policy of this state is to:  
|  (1) _as a paramount consideration, provide a safe,_  
| _healthy, stable, and nonviolent environment for the child; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____as feasible, while providing the environment_  
| _described by Subdivision (1):_  
|  _(A)_ assure that children will have frequent and  
| continuing contact with _each parent_ [ ~~parents~~ ] who _has_ [ ~~have~~ ]
shown  
| the ability to act in the best interest of the child;  
|  [ ~~(2)~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent~~  
|  ~~environment for the child;~~ ] and  
|  _(B)_ [ ~~(3)~~ ] encourage parents to share in the  
| rights and duties of raising their child after the parents have  
| separated or dissolved their marriage.  
|  _(c)_ _____The public policy of this state described by Subsection_  
| _(a) applies to all suits under this title and to all suits affecting_  
| _the parent-child relationship, including a dispute involving the_  
| _parent-child relationship referred as provided by Chapter 154,_  
| _Civil Practice and Remedies Code._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 153.002, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 153.002. BEST INTEREST OF CHILD. The best interest of  
| the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in  
| determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and  
| access to the child.  _In determining the best interest of the child,_  
| _providing a safe, healthy, stable, and nonviolent environment for_  
| _the child is the paramount consideration._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 153.004, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 153.004. HISTORY OF _FAMILY_ [ ~~DOMESTIC~~ ] VIOLENCE _,_ [ ~~OR~~ ]  
| SEXUAL ABUSE _, NEGLECT, ABUSE, OR EMOTIONAL ABUSE_. (a) _In every_  
| _suit regarding conservatorship, possession, or access involving an_  
| _allegation or a history of family violence, sexual abuse, neglect,_  
| _abuse, or emotional abuse, the court must first hold an evidentiary_  
| _hearing that is limited to evidence related to that issue. A_  
| _determination that family violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abuse,_  
| _or emotional abuse has been committed shall resolve issues in favor_  
| _of the parent who did not engage in that conduct and entitles the_  
| _child to protection from the parent who engaged in that conduct._ In  
| _the hearing_ [ ~~determining whether to appoint a party as a sole or~~  
|  ~~joint managing conservator,~~ ] the court shall consider _:_  
|  _(1)_ evidence of _family violence,_ the intentional use  
| of abusive physical force, or [ ~~evidence of~~ ] sexual abuse, by a party  
| directed against the party's spouse, a parent of the child, or any  
| person younger than 18 years of age committed _before_ [ ~~within a~~  
|  ~~two-year period preceding~~ ] the filing of the suit or during the  
| pendency of the suit _;_  
|  _(2)_ _____evidence of emotional abuse by a parent directed_  
| _against the other parent engaged in before the filing of the suit or_  
| _during the pendency of the suit; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____valid, scientific research concerning the lasting_  
| _effects on children of adverse childhood experiences, including_  
| _witnessing or experiencing family violence, sexual abuse, physical_  
| _abuse, or emotional abuse_.  
|  (b) The court may not appoint joint managing conservators if  
| credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or  
| present [ ~~child~~ ] neglect _, abuse_ , _family violence,_ or physical or  
| sexual abuse by one parent directed against the other parent, a  
| spouse, or a child, including a [ ~~sexual assault in~~ ] violation of  
| Section _21.02, 21.11,_ 22.011 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 22.021 _, or 25.02_ , Penal
Code[ ~~,~~  
|  ~~that results in the other parent becoming pregnant with the child~~ ].  
| A history of sexual abuse includes a sexual assault that results in  
| the other parent becoming pregnant with the child, regardless of  
| the prior relationship of the parents.  
|  _(b-1)_ _____The court may not appoint joint managing conservators_  
| _if credible evidence is presented of a pattern of past or present_  
| _emotional abuse by one parent directed against the other parent._  
|  _(b-2) The_ [ ~~It is a rebuttable presumption that the~~ ]  
| appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of a child  
| or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the  
| primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the  
| child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of _:_  
|  _(1)_ past or present [ ~~child~~ ] neglect _, abuse_ , _family_  
| _violence,_ or physical or sexual abuse by that parent directed  
| against the other parent, a spouse, or a child _; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____emotional abuse by a parent directed against the_  
| _other parent_.  
|  (c) The court shall consider the commission of family  
| violence _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] sexual abuse _, neglect, abuse, or emotional abuse_
in  
| determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit the possession of a  
| child by a parent who is appointed as a possessory conservator. _The_  
| _court in its findings for or against a denial, restriction, or_  
| _limitation shall consider valid, scientific research concerning_  
| _the lasting effects on children of adverse childhood experiences,_  
| _including witnessing or experiencing family violence, sexual_  
| _abuse, neglect, abuse, or emotional abuse._  
|  (d) The court may not allow a parent to have access to a  
| child for whom it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that:  
|  (1) there is a history or pattern of committing family  
| violence _before_ [ ~~during the two years preceding~~ ] the date of the  
| filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit; or  
|  (2) the parent engaged in conduct that constitutes an  
| offense under Section 21.02, _21.11,_ 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal  
| Code[ ~~, and that as a direct result of the conduct, the victim of the~~  
|  ~~conduct became pregnant with the parent's child~~ ].  
|  (d-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the court may allow a  
| parent to have access to a child if the court:  
|  (1) _after considering scientific research concerning_  
| _the lasting effects of adverse childhood experiences,_ finds _by_  
| _clear and convincing evidence_ that awarding the parent access to  
| the child would not endanger the child's physical health or  
| emotional welfare and would be in the best interest of the child;  
| and  
|  (2) renders a possession order that is designed to  
| protect the safety and well-being of the child and any other person  
| who has been a victim of family violence _or sexual abuse_ committed  
| by the parent and that may include a requirement that:  
|  (A) the periods of access be continuously  
| supervised by an entity or person chosen by the court;  
|  (B) the exchange of possession of the child occur  
| in a protective setting;  
|  (C) the parent abstain from the consumption of  
| alcohol or a controlled substance, as defined by Chapter 481,  
| Health and Safety Code, within 12 hours prior to or during the  
| period of access to the child; or  
|  (D) the parent attend and complete a battering  
| intervention and prevention program as provided by Article 42.141,  
| Code of Criminal Procedure, or, if such a program is not available,  
| complete _an accountability program_ [ ~~a course of treatment~~ ] under  
| Section 153.010.  
|  (e) It is [ ~~a rebuttable presumption that it is~~ ] not in the  
| best interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised  
| visitation with the child if credible evidence is presented of a  
| history or pattern of past or present [ ~~child~~ ] neglect _,_ [ ~~or~~ ]
abuse _,_  
| _sexual abuse,_ or family violence by:  
|  (1) that parent; or  
|  (2) any person who resides in that parent's household  
| or who is permitted by that parent to have unsupervised access to  
| the child during that parent's periods of possession of or access to  
| the child.  
|  _(e-1)_ _____It is not in the best interest of a child for a parent_  
| _to have unsupervised visitation with the child if credible evidence_  
| _is presented of the parent's history of a pattern of emotional abuse_  
| _or other behavior that is likely to cause the child to live with_  
| _fear and stress._  
|  (f) In determining under this section whether there is  
| credible evidence of a history or pattern of past or present [ ~~child~~ ]  
| neglect _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] abuse _, emotional abuse, sexual abuse,_ or family  
| violence by a parent or other person, as applicable, the court shall  
| consider whether a protective order was rendered under _Chapter 7A,_  
| _Code of Criminal Procedure, or_ Chapter 85 _of this code or whether a_  
| _magistrate's order of emergency protection was rendered under_  
| _Article 17.292, Code of Criminal Procedure_ , [ ~~Title 4,~~ ] against the  
| parent or other person _before_ [ ~~during the two-year period~~  
|  ~~preceding~~ ] the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the  
| suit.  
|  _(f-1)_ _____This section applies to suits under this title,_  
| _including a suit for modification under Chapter 156. An allegation_  
| _of family violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abuse, or emotional_  
| _abuse may be raised at any time and shall be heard separately in an_  
| _evidentiary hearing as provided by this section._  
|  (g) In this section:  
|  (1) "Abuse" and "neglect" have the meanings assigned  
| by Section 261.001.  
|  (2) _"Emotional abuse" means:_  
|  _(A)_ _____controlling and coercive tactics designed to_  
| _pressure a person to do what the actor wants based on fear of_  
| _consequences; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____conduct that meets the elements of the_  
| _offense of harassment under Section 42.07, Penal Code, or stalking_  
| _under Section 42.072, Penal Code_ [ ~~"Family violence" has the meaning~~  
|  ~~assigned by Section 71.004~~ ].  
|  SECTION 4. Subchapter A, Chapter 153, Family Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 153.0041 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___153.0041._ _____ENSURING SAFETY IN CASES OF FAMILY VIOLENCE_  
| _AND ABUSE. (a) This section applies to a suit affecting the_  
| _parent-child relationship under this title in which a party alleges_  
| _family violence or abuse by the other party, either during or before_  
| _a matter related to possession of or access to the child is_  
| _litigated._  
|  _(b)_ _____An evidentiary hearing limited to issues related to_  
| _family violence or abuse must be held and a determination made under_  
| _Section 153.004 before the court may appoint a professional who_  
| _provides advice or recommendations to the court. Any professional_  
| _subsequently appointed by the court must have substantial training_  
| _and experience in family violence and abuse matters to fully_  
| _understand safety issues, including:_  
|  _(1)_ _____behaviors that are associated with higher_  
| _lethality or injury risks;_  
|  _(2) family violence dynamics;_  
|  _(3) effects of family violence on children;_  
|  _(4) recognizing family violence; and_  
|  _(5)_ _____research about batterer narratives and batterer_  
| _accountability._  
|  _(c)_ _____A professional who does not have the expertise described_  
| _by Subsection (b) must consult with another professional who has_  
| _that expertise before making any recommendation to the court._  
|  _(d)_ _____The court shall consider current, valid, scientific_  
| _research concerning family violence and abuse when making a_  
| _decision in a suit. A court may not permit a practice or approach_  
| _that does not have a scientific basis and is not an accepted_  
| _practice within the specialized field of practice of family_  
| _violence and abuse. A professional who engages in practices based_  
| _on unscientific beliefs is not qualified to participate in a suit in_  
| _which family violence or abuse is raised during the course of the_  
| _suit._  
|  _(e)_ _____In this section, "abuse" has the meaning assigned by_  
| _Section 261.001._

| professional who:  
|  (A) has a background in family therapy;  
|  (B) has a mental health license that requires as

|  (2) pay the cost of counseling.  
|  (b) If a person possessing the requirements of Subsection  
| (a)(1) is not available in the county in which the court presides,  
| the court may appoint a person the court believes is qualified to

| _suit affecting the parent-child relationship._  
|  SECTION 8. Section 153.193, Family Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  Sec. 153.193. [ ~~MINIMAL~~ ] RESTRICTION ON PARENT'S POSSESSION

| to a parent or imposes restrictions or limitations on a parent's  
| right to possession of or access to a child _must_ [ ~~may not exceed~~  
|  ~~those that are required to~~ ] protect the best interest of the child.  
| _It is the policy of this state that providing a safe, healthy,_  
| _stable, and nonviolent environment for the child is the court's_  
| _paramount consideration._

|  SECTION 12. The changes in law made by this Act apply only  
| to a suit affecting the parent-child relationship pending in a  
| trial court on the effective date of this Act or filed on or after

| governed by the law in effect on the date the order was rendered,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 13. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

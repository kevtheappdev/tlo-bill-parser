|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to limiting possession of and access to a child by certain  
| parents.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 153.004, Family Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsections (d-2) and (d-3) to read as follows:  
|  _(d-2)_ _____The court may not appoint a child's parent as sole_  
| _managing conservator or joint managing conservator if the parent_  
| _has been convicted of an offense under Section 21.02, 21.11,_  
| _22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code, against a victim who was_  
| _younger than 18 years of age at the time of the offense._  
|  _(d-3)_ _____The court may not allow a parent described by_  
| _Subsection (d-2) to have unsupervised visitation with the child if_  
| _the parent committed the offense described by that subsection_  
| _during the five-year period preceding the filing of the suit or_  
| _during the pendency of the suit. If the parent committed the_  
| _offense described by Subsection (d-2) five or more years before the_  
| _filing of the suit, the court may allow the parent to have_  
| _unsupervised visitation with the child only if the court determines_  
| _that the visitation would be in the best interest of the child._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies to a  
| suit affecting the parent-child relationship pending before a trial  
| court or filed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. The enactment of this Act constitutes a material  
| and substantial change of circumstances sufficient to warrant  
| modification of a court order or portion of a decree that provides  
| for conservatorship or possession of or access to a child rendered  
| before the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

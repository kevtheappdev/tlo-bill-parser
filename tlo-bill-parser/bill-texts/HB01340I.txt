| Subsections (d-1) and (h-1) to read as follows:  
|  (b) The person who is required to file a fetal death  
| certificate under Section 193.002 _, on filing of any required fetal_  
| _death certificate or if otherwise involved in the disposition of_  
| _the stillborn child's remains,_ shall advise the parent or parents  
| of a stillborn child:  
|  (1) that a parent may, but is not required to, request  
| the preparation of a certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth;  
|  (2) that a parent may obtain a certificate of birth  
| resulting in stillbirth by contacting the vital statistics unit to

| contact the vital statistics unit to request the certificate.  
|  (c) A parent may provide a name for a stillborn child on the  
| request for a certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth. If the  
| requesting parent does not wish to provide a name, the vital  
| statistics unit shall fill in the certificate with the name "baby  
| boy" or "baby girl" and the last name of the parent. [ ~~The name of~~  
|  ~~the stillborn child provided on or later added by amendment to the~~  
|  ~~certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth shall be the same name~~  
|  ~~as placed on the original or amended fetal death certificate.~~ ]

| the date on which the _birth resulting in stillbirth occurred_ [ ~~fetal~~  
|  ~~death certificate was issued~~ ].  
|  _(h-1)_ _____A certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth is not_  
| _a fetal death certificate for purposes of Section 193.002, and the_  
| _issuance of a certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth under_

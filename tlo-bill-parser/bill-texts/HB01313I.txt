|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the authority of the chief appraiser of an appraisal  
| district to increase the appraised value of property in the tax year  
| following the year in which the appraised value of the property is  
| lowered as a result of a protest or appeal.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 23.01(e), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the  
| contrary, if the appraised value of property in a tax year is  
| lowered under Subtitle F, the appraised value of the property as  
| finally determined under that subtitle is considered to be the  
| appraised value of the property for that tax year.  In the following  
| tax year, the chief appraiser may not increase the appraised value  
| of the property unless the increase by the chief appraiser is  
| reasonably supported by _clear and convincing_ [ ~~substantial~~ ]  
| evidence when all of the reliable and probative evidence in the  
| record is considered as a whole. If the appraised value is finally  
| determined in a protest under Section 41.41(a)(2) or an appeal  
| under Section 42.26, the chief appraiser may satisfy the  
| requirement to reasonably support by _clear and convincing_  
| [ ~~substantial~~ ] evidence an increase in the appraised value of the  
| property in the following tax year by presenting evidence showing  
| that the inequality in the appraisal of property has been corrected  
| with regard to the properties that were considered in determining  
| the value of the subject property.  The burden of proof is on the  
| chief appraiser to support an increase in the appraised value of  
| property under the circumstances described by this subsection.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to the appraisal of  
| property for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

|  SECTION 1. Article 42A.751, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (c) and (d) and adding Subsection  
| (c-1) to read as follows:  
|  (c) Without any unnecessary delay, but not later than 48  
| hours after the defendant is arrested, the arresting officer or the  
| person with custody of the defendant shall take the defendant  
| before the judge who ordered the arrest for the alleged violation of  
| a condition of community supervision or, if the judge is  
| unavailable, before a magistrate of the county in which the  
| defendant was arrested. The judge or magistrate shall perform all  
| appropriate duties and may exercise all appropriate powers as  
| provided by Article 15.17 with respect to an arrest for a new  
| offense _. Except as provided by Subsection (c-1)_ , [ ~~except that~~ ]  
| only the judge who ordered the arrest for the alleged violation may  
| authorize the defendant's release on bail.  The defendant may be  
| taken before the judge or magistrate under this subsection by means  
| of an electronic broadcast system as provided by and subject to the  
| requirements of Article 15.17.  
|  _(c-1)_ _____Any magistrate in the county in which a defendant is_  
| _arrested for an alleged violation of a condition of community_  
| _supervision may release the defendant on bail if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the defendant is on community supervision for an_  
| _offense punishable as a misdemeanor;_  
|  _(2)_ _____the alleged violation of community supervision for_  
| _which the arrest is ordered involves only conduct constituting the_  
| _commission of a nonviolent offense that is punishable as a_  
| _misdemeanor; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____the defendant is arrested in the same county in_  
| _which the defendant is under community supervision._  
|  (d) If the defendant has not been released on bail as  
| permitted under _this article_ [ ~~Subsection (c)~~ ], on motion by the  
| defendant, the judge who ordered the arrest for the alleged  
| violation of a condition of community supervision shall cause the  
| defendant to be brought before the judge for a hearing on the  
| alleged violation within 20 days of the date the motion is filed.  
| After a hearing without a jury, the judge may continue, extend,  
| modify, or revoke the community supervision.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a person who is arrested on or after the effective date of this  
| Act. A person arrested before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the person was arrested,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.

|  ~~the first full week in May, except that the spring administration of~~  
|  ~~the end-of-course assessment instruments in English I and English~~  
|  ~~II must be permitted to occur at an earlier date~~ ].  
|  (e) _At least_ [ ~~Under rules adopted by the State Board of~~  
|  ~~Education,~~ ] every third year, the agency shall release the  
| questions and answer keys to each assessment instrument  
| administered under Subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (l), excluding  
| any assessment instrument administered to a student for the purpose  
| of retaking the assessment instrument, after the last time the  
| instrument is administered for that school year. To ensure a valid  
| bank of questions for use each year, the agency is not required to  
| release a question that is being field-tested and was not used to  
| compute the student's score on the instrument. The agency shall  
| also release[ ~~, under board rule,~~ ] each question that is no longer  
| being field-tested and that was not used to compute a student's  
| score. [ ~~During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, the~~

| the level of performance considered to be satisfactory on an  
| alternate assessment instrument. [ ~~The district may not administer~~

|  ~~instrument that assesses a subject that was not assessed in an~~

|  AN ACT  
| relating to the procedures for protests and appeals of certain ad  
| valorem tax determinations.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 41.45(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) A property owner initiating a protest is entitled to  
| appear to offer evidence or argument.  A property owner may offer  
| evidence or argument by affidavit without personally appearing and  
| may appear by telephone conference call to offer argument.  A  
| property owner who appears by telephone conference call must offer  
| any evidence by affidavit.  A property owner must submit an  
| affidavit described by this subsection to the board hearing the  
| protest before the board begins the hearing on the protest.  On  
| receipt of an affidavit, the board shall notify the chief  
| appraiser. The chief appraiser [ ~~may inspect the affidavit and~~ ] is  
| entitled to a copy _of the affidavit_ on request. _The board and the_  
| _chief appraiser shall review the evidence or argument provided by_  
| _the property owner before the hearing on the protest._  
|  SECTION 2. Chapter 42, Tax Code, is amended by adding

|  _Sec._ ___42.35._ _____APPLICABILITY OF SUBCHAPTER. This subchapter_  
| _applies only to the appeal of an order issued by an appraisal review_  
| _board that is located in a county:_

|  _Sec._ ___42.36._ _____APPEALS TO JUSTICE COURT. (a) As an_  
| _alternative to bringing an appeal under Section 42.01(a)(1) to a_  
| _district court as provided by Subchapter B, a property owner may_  
| _bring the appeal to a justice court if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the appeal relates only to a determination of_  
| _appraised value or eligibility for an exemption from taxation; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the amount of taxes due on the portion of the_  
| _taxable value of the property that is in dispute, calculated using_  
| _the preceding year's tax rates, is $5,000 or less._  
|  _(b)_ _____Venue of an action brought under Section 42.01(a)(1) in_

| _is the subject of the order being appealed is located._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the justice court determines that the justice court_  
| _does not have jurisdiction of the appeal, the court shall dismiss_  
| _the appeal. In that event, the property owner may appeal the order_  
| _to a district court by filing a petition for review with the_  
| _district court not later than the 30th day after the date of the_  
| _dismissal._  
|  _(d)_ _____Sections 42.21, 42.23, 42.24, 42.25, and 42.26 apply to_  
| _an appeal brought under Section 42.01(a)(1) to a justice court in_  
| _the same manner as those sections apply to an appeal brought under_  
| _Section 42.01(a)(1) to a district court._  
|  _Sec._ ___42.37._ _____REPRESENTATION IN JUSTICE COURT. In an appeal_  
| _brought under Section 42.01(a)(1) to a justice court, an appraisal_  
| _district may be, but is not required to be, represented by legal_  
| _counsel._  
|  _Sec._ ___42.38._ _____EXPIRATION OF SUBCHAPTER. This subchapter_  
| _expires September 1, 2025._  
|  SECTION 3. On the expiration of Subchapter B-1, Chapter 42,  
| Tax Code, as added by this Act, the Office of Court Administration  
| of the Texas Judicial System, using existing resources, shall  
| conduct a study on that subchapter's effectiveness in increasing  
| court efficiency and improving property owners' ability to exercise  
| their appeal rights under Chapter 42, Tax Code. Not later than  
| December 1, 2026, the office shall issue a report on the study to  
| the appropriate standing committees of the house of representatives  
| and the senate. The report must include the office's

| legislative session following the issuance of the report, should  
| enact legislation similar to Subchapter B-1, Chapter 42, Tax Code,  
| as added by this Act.  
|  SECTION 4. An appeal under Subchapter B-1, Chapter 42, Tax  
| Code, as added by this Act, that is pending on September 1, 2025, is  
| governed by that subchapter as it existed on August 31, 2025, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. The change in law made by this Act applies to the  
| appeal of an order of an appraisal review board without regard to  
| whether the order was issued before the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

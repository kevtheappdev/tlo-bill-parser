|  SECTION 1. Section 2(d), Article 37.071, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) The court shall charge the jury that:  
|  (1) in deliberating on the issues submitted under  
| Subsection (b) [ ~~of this article~~ ], _the jury_ [ ~~it~~ ] shall consider
all  
| evidence admitted at the guilt or innocence stage and the  
| punishment stage, including evidence of the defendant's background  
| or character or the circumstances of the offense that militates for  
| or mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty;  
|  (2) _the jury_ [ ~~it~~ ] may not answer any issue submitted  
| under Subsection (b) [ ~~of this article~~ ] "yes" unless _the jury_ [
~~it~~ ]  
| agrees unanimously [ ~~and it may not answer any issue "no" unless 10~~  
|  ~~or more jurors agree~~ ]; and  
|  (3) members of the jury need not agree on what  
| particular evidence supports a negative answer to any issue  
| submitted under Subsection (b) [ ~~of this article~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. Section 2(f), Article 37.071, Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, is amended to read as follows:

| issue submitted under Subsection (e) [ ~~of this article~~ ], the jury:  
|  (1) shall answer the issue "yes" or "no";  
|  (2) may not answer the issue "no" unless _the jury_ [ ~~it~~ ]  
| agrees unanimously [ ~~and may not answer the issue "yes" unless 10 or~~  
|  ~~more jurors agree~~ ];  
|  (3) need not agree on what particular evidence  
| supports an affirmative finding on the issue; and

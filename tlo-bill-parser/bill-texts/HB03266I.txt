| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The board of regents of The Texas A&M University System  
| may levy a regular, fixed student fee on each student enrolled in an  
| educational institution within The Texas A&M University System for  
| the purpose of acquiring, constructing, renovating, operating,

| within The Texas A&M University System.  
|  (e) The _amount of the_ fee authorized by this section may not  
| be increased from one academic year to the next _by 10 percent or_  
| _more,_ unless the increase has been approved by a majority vote of  
| the students at the affected institution participating in a general  
| election called for that purpose _or_ , _if the amount of the fee_  
| _increase does not exceed 10 percent, the amount of the fee increase_  
| _has been approved by a majority vote of the board of regents taken_  
| _at a board meeting on the increase after giving students an_  
| _opportunity for public comment on the increase_ [ ~~except that at~~  
|  ~~Tarleton State University the fee may be increased by not more than~~  
|  ~~10 percent from one academic year to the next without holding an~~  
|  ~~election~~ ].  The fee may not exceed the maximum amounts provided by  
| Subsection (a).  
|  SECTION 5. Sections 54.507 and 54.521, Education Code, as  
| amended by this Act, apply beginning with fees charged for the  
| 2019-2020 academic year. A fee charged in an academic year before  
| that academic year is covered by the law in effect before the  
| effective date of this Act, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as

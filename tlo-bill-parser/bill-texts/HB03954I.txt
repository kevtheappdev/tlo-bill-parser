| fuel distribution system consisting of refineries, pipelines,  
| marine vessels, _motor fuel storage facilities,_ and IRS-approved  
| terminals. Motor fuel is in the bulk transfer/terminal system if  
| the motor fuel is in a refinery, a pipeline, _a motor fuel storage_  
| _facility,_ a terminal, or a marine vessel transporting motor fuel  
| _owned by a licensed supplier or permissive supplier_ [ ~~to a refinery~~

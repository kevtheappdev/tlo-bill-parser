| committee must be composed of:

| comptroller:  
|  (A) one representative of a school district that

| is entitled to state aid under Chapter 42, Education Code;  
|  (C) one member of a county commissioners court;  
|  (D) one member of the governing body of a  
| municipality;  
|  (E) one member of the governing body of a  
| political subdivision other than a school district, county, or  
| municipality;  
|  (F) one or more representatives of appraisal  
| districts;  
|  (G) one or more representatives of the profession  
| of real estate agents;  
|  (H) one or more representatives of property tax  
| payers;  
|  (I) one or more representatives of organizations  
| interested in the effect of public policy on low-income and  
| moderate-income households; and  
|  (J) one or more representatives of other  
| appropriate interested organizations or members of the public, as  
| determined by the comptroller;

|  (3) one member of the senate appointed by the  
| lieutenant governor.  
|  (c) The comptroller, with the assistance of the advisory  
| committee, shall study:  
|  (1) the impact on the property tax system, property  
| tax revenue of school districts and other taxing units, the  
| allocation of property tax burdens among taxpayers, and the cost to  
| the state to fund public education:  
|  (A) under the current system in which the  
| disclosure of the sales price of real property is not required by  
| law; and  
|  (B) under a system in which the disclosure of the  
| sales price of real property would be required by law;  
|  (2) the statutory and administrative changes that  
| would be necessary to effectively collect, disseminate, and use  
| sales price information;  
|  (3) the annual cost to purchase real property sales  
| price information from a private entity, such as a multiple listing  
| service, compared to the annual cost to obtain that information  
| under a system in which the disclosure of the sales price of real  
| property would be required by law; and  
|  (4) the annual cost to appraisal districts of all  
| property tax protests and appeals filed under Chapters 41, 41A, and  
| 42, Tax Code, and Subchapter Z, Chapter 2003, Government Code.  
|  (d) In studying the allocation of property tax burdens among  
| taxpayers, the comptroller and the advisory committee must compare  
| the tax burden among property owners of each classification of real  
| property, including a comparison of the burden on owners of:  
|  (1) commercial properties as compared to  
| single-family residential properties;  
|  (2) industrial properties as compared to  
| single-family residential properties; and  
|  (3) single-family residential properties for which  
| the sales price of the property is provided by a private entity,  
| such as a multiple listing service, to a chief appraiser for use by  
| the chief appraiser in determining the appraised value of the  
| property as compared to single-family residential properties for  
| which the sales price is not provided.  
|  (e) The comptroller and the advisory committee shall  
| prepare a report that:  
|  (1) makes findings and recommendations regarding the  
| issues studied under Subsection (c) of this section;  
|  (2) forecasts the fiscal impact to state revenue for  
| the following three state fiscal bienniums under a system in which  
| the disclosure of the sales price of real property would be required  
| by law as compared to a system in which the sales price of real  
| property is not required by law; and  
|  (3) lists each type of taxing unit that would be  
| impacted under a system in which the disclosure of the sales price  
| of real property would be required by law.  
|  (f) The comptroller may contract with appraisal districts,  
| taxing units, or other appropriate entities for assistance and to  
| obtain information necessary to conduct the study. A state agency,  
| appraisal district, or taxing unit shall assist the comptroller if  
| the comptroller requests information or assistance in conducting  
| the study.  
|  (g) Not later than December 1, 2020, the comptroller shall  
| submit to the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker of the  
| house of representatives the report prepared under Subsection (e)  
| of this section.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act expires September 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| criminal proceedings.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Articles 15.17(a) and (f), Code of Criminal  
| Procedure, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In each case enumerated in this Code, the person making  
| the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall  
| without unnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the  
| person is arrested, take the person arrested or have him taken  
| before some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested  
| or, to provide more expeditiously to the person arrested the  
| warnings described by this article, before a magistrate in any  
| other county of this state. The arrested person may be taken before  
| the magistrate in person or the image of the arrested person may be  
| presented to the magistrate by means of a videoconference. The  
| magistrate shall inform in clear language the person arrested,  
| either in person or through a videoconference, of the accusation  
| against him and of any affidavit filed therewith, of his right to  
| retain counsel, of his right to remain silent, of his right to have  
| an attorney present during any interview with peace officers or  
| attorneys representing the state, of his right to terminate the  
| interview at any time, and of his right to have an examining trial.  
| The magistrate shall also inform the person arrested of the  
| person's right to request the appointment of counsel if the person  
| cannot afford counsel. The magistrate shall inform the person  
| arrested of the procedures for requesting appointment of counsel.  
| If the person does not speak and understand the English language or  
| is deaf, the magistrate shall inform the person in a manner  
| consistent with Articles 38.30 and 38.31, as appropriate. The  
| magistrate shall ensure that reasonable assistance in completing  
| the necessary forms for requesting appointment of counsel is  
| provided to the person at the same time. If the person arrested is  
| indigent and requests appointment of counsel and if the magistrate  
| is authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent  
| defendants in the county, the magistrate shall appoint counsel in  
| accordance with Article 1.051. If the magistrate is not authorized  
| to appoint counsel, the magistrate shall without unnecessary delay,  
| but not later than 24 hours after the person arrested requests  
| appointment of counsel, transmit, or cause to be transmitted to the  
| court or to the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to  
| appoint counsel in the county, the forms requesting the appointment  
| of counsel. The magistrate shall also inform the person arrested  
| that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement  
| made by him may be used against him. The magistrate shall allow the  
| person arrested reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel  
| and shall, after determining whether the person is currently on  
| bail for a separate criminal offense, admit the person arrested to  
| bail if allowed by law. A record of the communication between the  
| arrested person and the magistrate shall be made. [ ~~The record shall~~  
|  ~~be preserved until the earlier of the following dates: (1) the date~~  
|  ~~on which the pretrial hearing ends; or (2) the 91st day after the~~  
|  ~~date on which the record is made if the person is charged with a~~  
|  ~~misdemeanor or the 120th day after the date on which the record is~~  
|  ~~made if the person is charged with a felony.~~ ] For purposes of this  
| subsection, "videoconference" means a two-way electronic  
| communication of image and sound between the arrested person and  
| the magistrate and includes secure Internet videoconferencing.  
|  (f) A record required under Subsection (a) or (e) may  
| consist of written forms, electronic recordings, or other  
| documentation as authorized by procedures adopted in the county  
| under Article 26.04(a). _The record must be retained in compliance_  
| _with the applicable records retention schedule prepared by the_

| _Commission under Section 441.158, Government Code._ The counsel for  
| the defendant may obtain a copy of the record on payment of a  
| reasonable amount to cover the costs of reproduction or, if the  
| defendant is indigent, the court shall provide a copy to the  
| defendant without charging a cost for the copy.  
|  SECTION 2. Article 27.18, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsection (d) and adding Subsection (h) to  
| read as follows:

| county in which charges against the defendant are pending may use

| _equal parenting, unless the court determines that order is not in_  
| _the best interest of the child, in which case the court may enter:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a standard possession order as provided by_  
| _Subchapter F; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____another order regarding possession that the court_

| _accordance with this subchapter if the court:_

| _provided that:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the schedule may not grant possession to a parent_  
| _for a number of days each year that exceeds the number of days of_  
| _possession granted to the other parent for that year by more than_  
| _five days; and_

| _parents do not agree, the court may order possession under any_  
| _schedule described by Subsection (a)._  
|  SECTION 4. The enactment of this Act does not constitute a

| warrant modification of a court order or portion of a decree that  
| provides for the possession of or access to a child rendered before  
| the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 5. The change in law made by this Act applies to a  
| suit affecting the parent-child relationship that is pending in a

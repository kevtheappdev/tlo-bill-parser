|  _(4)_ _____jurisdiction in all cases assigned, transferred,_  
| _or heard under Sections 74.054, 74.059, and 74.094._  
|  _(b)_ _____A county court at law has original concurrent_  
| _jurisdiction with the justice courts in all civil and criminal_  
| _matters prescribed by law for justice courts. Appeals from justice_  
| _courts and other courts of inferior jurisdiction in Reeves County_  
| _must be made directly to a county court at law._  
|  _(c) A county court at law does not have jurisdiction of:_  
|  _(1) felony cases, except as otherwise provided by law;_  
|  _(2)_ _____misdemeanors involving official misconduct unless_  
| _assigned under Sections 74.054 and 74.059;_  
|  _(3) contested elections; or_  
|  _(4)_ _____except as provided by Subsections (a)(1)(D) and_  
| _(E),_ family law cases [ ~~and proceedings~~ ].  
|  (e) _A_ [ ~~The~~ ] judge of a county court at law _in Reeves County_  
| shall be paid an annual salary _equal to the amount that is $1,000_  
| _less than_ [ ~~that does not exceed 90 percent of~~ ] the [ ~~total~~ ]
salary  
| paid _by_ the _state to a_ district judge _in the county_. The salary  
| shall be paid _in the same manner and from the same fund as_  
| _prescribed by law for the county judge_ [ ~~out of the county treasury~~  
|  ~~on order of the commissioners court. The judge is entitled to~~  
|  ~~travel expenses and necessary office expenses, including~~  
|  ~~administrative and clerical assistance~~ ].  
|  _(f)_ _____A county court at law may not issue writs of habeas_  
| _corpus in felony cases._  
|  (g) The district clerk serves as clerk of a county court at  
| law in _the_ [ ~~family law~~ ] cases _described by Subsection (a). The_  
| _district clerk shall establish a separate docket for each county_  
| _court at law. In matters of concurrent jurisdiction with the_  
| _district court, the district clerk shall charge the same fees as are_  
| _allowed in district court cases, except that in cases described by_  
| _Subsections (a)(1)(A) and (2) and in misdemeanor cases other than_  
| _those involving official misconduct, the clerk may not charge_  
| _higher fees than the fees charged by county clerks for similar cases_  
| [ ~~and proceedings, and the county clerk serves as clerk of the court~~  
|  ~~in all other matters~~ ].  
|  _(h)_ _____If a jury trial is requested in a case that is in a_  
| _county court at law's jurisdiction, the jury shall be composed of 6_  
| _members unless the constitution requires a 12-member jury. Failure_  
| _to object before a 6-member jury is seated and sworn constitutes a_  
| _waiver of a 12-member jury._  
|  (i) _If any cause or proceeding is lodged with the district_  
| _clerk and the district clerk files, dockets, or assigns the cause or_  
| _proceeding in or to a county court at law that does not have subject_  
| _matter jurisdiction over the cause or proceeding, the filing,_  
| _docketing, or assignment of the cause or proceeding in or to a_  
| _county court at law is considered a clerical error. That clerical_  
| _error must be corrected by a judgment or order nunc pro tunc. The_  
| _cause or proceeding is considered filed, docketed, or assigned to_  
| _the district court of the local administrative judge in the first_  
| _instance rather than to the county court at law. The judge of a_  
| _county court at law who acts in the cause or proceeding is_  
| _considered assigned to the district court of the local_  
| _administrative judge for that purpose and has all the powers of the_  
| _judge of that district court under the assignment_ [ ~~Practice in a~~  
|  ~~county court at law is that prescribed by law for county courts,~~  
|  ~~except that practice and procedure, rules of evidence, issuance of~~  
|  ~~process and writs, and all other matters pertaining to the conduct~~  
|  ~~of trials and hearings involving family law cases and proceedings~~  
|  ~~are governed by this section and the laws and rules pertaining to~~  
|  ~~district courts. If a family law case is tried before a jury, the~~  
|  ~~jury shall be composed of 12 members~~ ].  
|  SECTION 2. Section 25.1972(k), Government Code, is  
| repealed.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| increase the number of physicians and other health care providers

| organization to provide Medicaid benefits to recipients under the  
| STAR Kids managed care program operated under Section 533.071,  
| Government Code, as transferred, redesignated, and amended by this

| transferred, redesignated, and amended by this Act, before the  
| effective date of this Act to ensure those contracts comply with the  
| provisions of Subchapter C, Chapter 533, Government Code, as added  
| by this Act. To the extent of a conflict between a provision of that  
| subchapter and a term of a contract with a managed care organization  
| entered into before the effective date of this Act, the contract  
| provision prevails.  
|  SECTION 17. If before implementing any provision of this  
| Act a state agency determines that a waiver or authorization from a  
| federal agency is necessary for implementation of that provision,  
| the agency affected by the provision shall request the waiver or  
| authorization and may delay implementing that provision until the  
| waiver or authorization is granted.

|  SECTION 2. Section 92A.001, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 92A.001. DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:  
|  (1) _"Domestic animal" means a dog, cat, or other_  
| _domesticated animal that may be kept as a household pet. The term_  
| _does not include a livestock animal, as defined by Section 87.001._

| physical or mental disease, defect, or injury is substantially  
| unable to protect the individual's self from harm.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 92A.002, Civil Practice and Remedies  
| Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 92A.002. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  A person who, by  
| force or otherwise, enters a motor vehicle for the purpose of  
| removing a vulnerable individual _or a domestic animal_ from the  
| vehicle is immune from civil liability for damages resulting from  
| that entry or removal if the person:  
|  (1) determines that:  
|  (A) the motor vehicle is locked; or  
|  (B) there is no reasonable method for the  
| individual _or animal_ to exit the motor vehicle without assistance;  
|  (2) has a good faith and reasonable belief, based on  
| known circumstances, that entry into the motor vehicle is necessary  
| to avoid imminent harm to the individual _or animal_ ;  
|  (3) before entering the motor vehicle, ensures that  
| law enforcement is notified or 911 is called if the person is not a  
| law enforcement officer or other first responder;  
|  (4) uses no more force to enter the motor vehicle and  
| remove the individual _or animal_ than is necessary; and  
|  (5) remains with the individual _or animal_ in a safe  
| location that is in reasonable proximity to the motor vehicle until  
| a law enforcement officer or other first responder arrives.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a cause of action that accrues on or after the effective date of  
| this Act.  A cause of action that accrued before the effective date  
| of this Act is governed by the law applicable to the cause of action  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

| private education program, none of the costs may be paid from public  
| education funds. If a residential placement primarily for care or  
| treatment reasons involves a private residential facility in which  
| the education program is provided by the school district, the  
| portion of the costs that includes appropriate education services,  
| as determined by _the individualized education program team_ [ ~~the~~  
|  ~~school district's admission, review, and dismissal committee~~ ],  
| shall be paid from state and federal education funds.

| child's individualized education program.  
|  (b) The _individualized education program team_ [ ~~committee~~ ]  
| shall develop the individualized education program by agreement of  
| the _team_ [ ~~committee~~ ] members or, if those persons cannot agree, by  
| an alternate method provided by the agency. Majority vote may not  
| be used to determine the individualized education program.

|  (1) the date of the meeting;  
|  (2) the name, position, and signature of each member  
| participating in the meeting; and  
|  (3) an indication of whether the child's parents, the  
| adult student, if applicable, and the administrator agreed or  
| disagreed with the decisions of the _team_ [ ~~committee~~ ].  
|  (c) If the individualized education program is not  
| developed by agreement, the written statement of the program  
| required under 20 U.S.C. Section 1414(d) must include the basis of  
| the disagreement. Each member of the _individualized education_  
| _program team_ [ ~~committee~~ ] who disagrees with the individualized

| may determine that a behavior improvement plan or a behavioral  
| intervention plan is appropriate for a student for whom the _team_  
| [ ~~committee~~ ] has developed an individualized education program. If  
| the _team_ [ ~~committee~~ ] makes that determination, the behavior  
| improvement plan or the behavioral intervention plan shall be  
| included as part of the student's individualized education program  
| and provided to each teacher with responsibility for educating the  
| student.  
|  SECTION 14. Sections 29.011(a) and (a-1), Education Code,  
| are amended to read as follows:

| aid of technology. The English I and English II end-of-course  
| assessment instruments must each assess essential knowledge and  
| skills in both reading and writing in the same assessment  
| instrument and must provide a single score. A school district  
| shall comply with State Board of Education rules regarding

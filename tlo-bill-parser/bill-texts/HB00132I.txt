|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a limitation on the amount of tuition charged by public  
| institutions of higher education.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 54, Education Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 54.0514 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___54.0514._ _____LIMITATION ON TOTAL AMOUNT OF TUITION. (a)_  
| _In this section, "tuition" includes:_  
|  _(1)_ _____tuition for which the rates are prescribed by this_  
| _chapter; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____tuition charged by an institution of higher_  
| _education under Section 54.0513 or another law authorizing an_  
| _institution to establish tuition rates._  
|  _(a-1)_ _____This section does not apply to tuition charged by an_  
| _institution of higher education for an academic period before the_  
| _2020-2021 academic year._ ___This subsection expires January 1, 2021._  
|  _(b)_ _____The total amount of tuition charged by an institution of_  
| _higher education to a student for an academic year may not exceed_  
| _the total amount of tuition that the institution would have charged_  
| _under this chapter to a similarly situated student for the_  
| _2019-2020 academic year. For purposes of this subsection, students_  
| _are similarly situated if they share the same residency status,_  
| _degree program, course load, course level, tuition exemption_  
| _status, and other circumstances affecting the tuition charged to_  
| _students. This subsection does not ensure that the total amount of_  
| _tuition charged to an individual student does not increase based on_  
| _a change in the student's residency status, degree program, course_  
| _load, course level, tuition exemption status, or other circumstance_  
| _affecting the tuition charged to the student._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 54.0513(a) and (b), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In addition to amounts that a governing board of an  
| institution of higher education is authorized to charge as tuition  
| under the other provisions of this chapter, the governing board[ ~~,~~  
|  ~~under the terms the governing board considers appropriate,~~ ] may  
| charge any student an amount designated as tuition _, not to exceed_  
| _the amount that enables the institution to comply with Section_  
| _54.0514,_ that the governing board considers necessary for the  
| effective operation of the institution.  
|  (b) _Subject to the limit provided by Subsection (a) on the_  
| _amount designated as tuition charged under this section, a_ [ ~~A~~ ]  
| governing board may set a different tuition rate _under this section_  
| for each program and course level offered by each institution of  
| higher education[ ~~. A governing board may set a different tuition~~  
|  ~~rate~~ ] as the governing board considers appropriate to increase  
| graduation rates, encourage efficient use of facilities, or enhance  
| employee performance.  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 54.0515(e) and (f), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (e) It is the legislature's intent that each institution of  
| higher education[ ~~, as a condition to tuition deregulation under~~  
|  ~~Section 54.0513,~~ ] reasonably implement the following:  
|  (1) each institution shall make satisfactory progress  
| towards the goals provided in its master plan for higher education  
| and in "Closing the Gaps," the state's master plan for higher  
| education _, or a successor state master plan_ ; and  
|  (2) each institution shall meet acceptable  
| performance criteria, including measures such as graduation rates,  
| retention rates, enrollment growth, educational quality, efforts  
| to enhance minority participation, opportunities for financial  
| aid, and affordability.  
|  (f) The committee shall:  
|  (1) meet at the call of either chair;  
|  (2) monitor and regularly report to the legislature on  
| each institution of higher education's compliance with the  
| requirements of Subsection (e); and  
|  (3) receive and review information concerning the  
| affordability and accessibility of higher education[ ~~, including~~  
|  ~~the impact of tuition deregulation~~ ].  
|  SECTION 4. This Act applies beginning with tuition charged  
| by public institutions of higher education for the 2020 fall  
| semester. Tuition charged by an institution of higher education in  
| an academic period before that semester is covered by the law in  
| effect before the effective date of this Act, and the former law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.

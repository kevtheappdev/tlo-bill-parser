| relating to public school finance, supporting public education  
| funding through an increase in the state sales and use tax rate, and  
| requiring a reduction in school district maintenance and operation  
| ad valorem taxes; making an appropriation; increasing the rate of a

|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Effective September 1, 2020, Section 41.002(a),  
| Education Code, is amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) A school district may not have a wealth per student that  
| exceeds:  
|  (1) the wealth per student that generates the amount  
| of maintenance and operations tax revenue per weighted student  
| available to a district with maintenance and operations tax revenue  
| per cent of tax effort equal to the maximum amount provided per cent  
| under Section 42.101(a) or (b), for the district's maintenance and  
| operations tax effort equal to or less than the rate equal to the  
| sum of the product of the state compression percentage, as  
| determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and  
| operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year  
| and any additional tax effort included in calculating the  
| district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1);  
|  (2) the wealth per student that generates the amount  
| of maintenance and operations tax revenue per weighted student  
| available to the Austin Independent School District, as determined  
| by the commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative Budget  
| Board, for the first six cents by which the district's maintenance  
| and operations tax rate exceeds the rate equal to the sum of the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax  
| rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year and any  
| additional tax effort included in calculating the district's  
| compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1), subject to Section  
| 41.093(b-1); or  
|  (3) _the wealth per student that yields the guaranteed_  
| _level of state and local funds per weighted student in average daily_  
| _attendance per cent of tax effort as provided by Section_  
| _42.302(a-1)(2)_ [ ~~$319,500~~ ], for the district's maintenance and  
| operations tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort  
| described by Subdivision (2).  
|  SECTION 2. Effective September 1, 2020, Section 42.101,  
| Education Code, is amended by amending Subsection (a) and adding  
| Subsections (a-3) and (a-4) to read as follows:  
|  (a) _Except as provided by Subsection (a-3), for_ [ ~~For~~ ] each  
| student in average daily attendance, not including the time  
| students spend each day in special education programs in an  
| instructional arrangement other than mainstream or career and  
| technology education programs, for which an additional allotment is  
| made under Subchapter C, a district is entitled to an allotment  
| equal to the lesser of _$5,140_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] or the amount that results  
| from the following formula:  
| A = _$5,140_ [ ~~$4,765~~ ] X (DCR/MCR)  
| where:  
|  "A" is the allotment to which a district is entitled;  
|  "DCR" is the district's compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax  
| rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year; and  
|  "MCR" is the state maximum compressed tax rate, which is the  
| product of the state compression percentage, as determined under  
| Section 42.2516, multiplied by $1.50.  
|  _(a-3)_ _____Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, the_  
| _commissioner shall recompute the amount of the basic allotment_  
| _under Subsection (a) to the maximum amount possible using the funds_  
| _appropriated to the foundation school fund under Section 151.803,_  
| _Tax Code, after the additional costs under Sections 41.002(a)(3)_  
| _and 42.302, as amended by __.B. ___, Acts of the 86th Legislature,_  
| _Regular Session, 2019, are deducted, including the required_  
| _reduction in the calculation of compressed tax rates under_  
| _Subsection (a-4)._  
|  _(a-4)_ _____Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, the_  
| _commissioner shall recompute the calculation of each district's_  
| _maximum compressed tax rate under Subsections (a) and (a-1) and the_  
| _district's tax rate under Section 42.252 to be a rate that would_  
| _entitle the district to an amount of state and local funds per_  
| _weighted student in average daily attendance in the current year,_  
| _using the basic allotment under Subsection (a), equal to the amount_  
| _of state and local funds to which the district would have been_  
| _entitled under Chapter 41 and this chapter for the current school_  
| _year if the guaranteed level under Subsection (a) had remained at_  
| _$5,140._  
|  SECTION 3. Effective September 1, 2020, Section 42.302,  
| Education Code, is amended by amending Subsection (a-1) and adding

|  (a-1) For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount  
| guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per  
| cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:  
|  (1) the greater of the amount of district tax revenue  
| per weighted student per cent of tax effort that would be available  
| to the Austin Independent School District, as determined by the  
| commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative Budget Board, if  
| the reduction of the limitation on tax increases as provided by  
| Section 11.26(a-1), (a-2), or (a-3), Tax Code, did not apply, or the  
| amount of district tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax  
| effort used for purposes of this subdivision in the preceding  
| school year, for the first six cents by which the district's  
| maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds the rate equal to the  
| sum of the product of the state compression percentage, as  
| determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and  
| operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year  
| and any additional tax effort included in calculating the  
| district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1); and  
|  (2) _the quotient of the maximum basic allotment_  
| _allowed under Section 42.101(a) or (b) divided by 100_ [ ~~$31.95~~ ], for  
| the district's maintenance and operations tax effort that exceeds  
| the amount of tax effort described by Subdivision (1).  
|  _(a-3)_ _____For the 2020-2021 school year, the commissioner shall_  
| _recompute the calculation of "DTR" under Subsection (a) for each_  
| _school district to be a rate that would entitle the district to an_  
| _amount of state and local funds per weighted student in average_  
| _daily attendance in the current year, using the guaranteed level of_  
| _state and local funds per cent of tax effort under Subsection_  
| _(a-1)(2), equal to the amount of state and local funds to which the_  
| _district would have been entitled under this chapter for the_  
| _current school year if the guaranteed level under Subsection_  
| _(a-1)(2) had remained at $31.95._  
|  SECTION 4. Effective September 1, 2020, Section 45.003,  
| Education Code, is amended by adding Subsection (g) to read as  
| follows:

| _tax rate that may be adopted under this section is reduced by the_

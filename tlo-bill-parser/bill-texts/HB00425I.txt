|  SECTION 2. (a)  The Employees Retirement System of Texas  
| shall make a one-time supplemental payment of a retirement or death  
| benefit, as provided by this section.  
|  (b) A supplemental payment is payable in January 2020, and,  
| to the extent practicable, on a date or dates that coincide with the  
| regular annuity payment payable to each eligible annuitant.  
|  (c) The amount of the supplemental payment is equal to the  
| lesser of:  
|  (1) $2,000; or  
|  (2) the gross amount of the regular annuity payment to  
| which the eligible annuitant is otherwise entitled for the month of  
| December 2019.  
|  (d) The Employees Retirement System of Texas shall make  
| applicable tax withholding and other legally required deductions  
| before disbursing the supplemental payment. A supplemental payment  
| under this section is in addition to and not in lieu of the regular  
| monthly annuity payment to which the eligible annuitant is  
| otherwise entitled.  
|  (e) Subject to Subsections (f) and (g) of this section, to  
| be eligible for the supplemental payment, a person must be, for the  
| month of December 2019, an annuitant eligible to receive:  
|  (1) a standard retirement annuity payment;  
|  (2) an optional service retirement annuity payment as  
| either a retiree or beneficiary under Section 814.108, Government  
| Code;  
|  (3) a standard or occupational disability retirement  
| annuity payment;

| optional retirement payment plan, to be eligible for the  
| supplemental payment, the effective date of the retirement of the  
| member of the Employees Retirement System of Texas must have been on  
| or before September 1, 2018. The supplemental payment shall be made  
| to an alternate payee who is an annuitant under Section 804.005,  
| Government Code, only if the annuity payment to the alternate payee  
| commenced on or before September 1, 2018.  The supplemental payment  
| is in addition to the guaranteed number of payments under Section  
| 814.108, Government Code, and may not be counted as one of the  
| guaranteed monthly payments.  
|  (g) The supplemental payment does not apply to payments  
| under:  
|  (1) Section 814.103 or 814.205, Government Code,  
| relating to retirees or disability retirees from the elected class  
| of membership;  
|  (2) a subtitle other than Subtitle B, Title 8,  
| Government Code, except as provided by Subsection (e)(5) of this  
| section; or  
|  (3) Section 814.304, Government Code, relating to  
| retiree survivor beneficiaries who receive a survivor annuity as  
| the surviving spouse of a member of the elected class.  
|  (h) Except as provided by this section, the board of  
| trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas shall  
| determine the eligibility for and the amount and timing of a  
| supplemental payment and the manner in which the payment is made.  
|  (i) The supplemental payment is subject solely to the  
| availability of appropriated funds.  The supplemental payment must  
| comply with Section 811.006, Government Code.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 814.604, Government Code, is repealed.

| as added by this Act, apply only to a monthly benefit payment made  
| by the Employees Retirement System of Texas on or after September 1,  
| 2019.

|  SECTION 1. Section 11.13, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (s) to read as follows:

| _or a greater percentage not to exceed 25 percent specified by the_  
| _governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner_  
| _provided by law for official action by the body, of the average_  
| _appraised value in the current tax year of all residence homesteads_  
| _that are located in the same county as the individual's homestead_  
| _and that qualify for an exemption under this section._ ___The chief_  
| _appraiser shall determine the average appraised value of those_  
| _residence homesteads according to the appraisal records as of_  
| _August 1, including all corrections and changes made as a result of_  
| _actions taken under Section 25.25 and Chapters 41 and 42 as of that_  
| _date._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 25.19(b), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (b) The chief appraiser shall separate real from personal  
| property and include in the notice for each:  
|  (1) a list of the taxing units in which the property is  
| taxable;  
|  (2) the appraised value of the property in the  
| preceding year;  
|  (3) the taxable value of the property in the preceding  
| year for each taxing unit taxing the property;  
|  (4) the appraised value of the property for the  
| current year, the kind and amount of each exemption and partial  
| exemption, if any, approved for the property for the current year  
| and for the preceding year, _including an estimate for each taxing_  
| _unit of the amount of the exemption under Section 11.13(s), if_  
| _applicable, approved for the property for the current year,_ and, if  
| an exemption or partial exemption that was approved for the  
| preceding year was canceled or reduced for the current year, the  
| amount of the exemption or partial exemption canceled or reduced;  
|  (5) if the appraised value is greater than it was in  
| the preceding year, the amount of tax that would be imposed on the  
| property on the basis of the tax rate for the preceding year;  
|  (6) in italic typeface, the following  
| statement: "The Texas Legislature does not set the amount of your  
| local taxes. Your property tax burden is decided by your locally  
| elected officials, and all inquiries concerning your taxes should  
| be directed to those officials _._ ";  
|  (7) a detailed explanation of the time and procedure  
| for protesting the value;  
|  (8) the date and place the appraisal review board will  
| begin hearing protests; and  
|  (9) a brief explanation that the governing body of  
| each taxing unit decides whether [ ~~or not~~ ] taxes on the property will  
| increase and _that_ the appraisal district only determines the value  
| of the property.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed  
| for a tax year beginning on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| an exemption from ad valorem taxation of a portion of the assessed  
| value of a residence homestead based on the average assessed value  
| of all qualified residence homesteads that are located in the same  
| county as the homestead is approved by the voters. If that  
| amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

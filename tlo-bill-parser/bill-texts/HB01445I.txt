|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to prohibiting carrying a firearm while intoxicated;  
| creating an offense.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 46, Penal Code, is amended by adding  
| Section 46.025 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___46.025._ _____UNLAWFUL CARRYING OF FIREARM WHILE_  
| _INTOXICATED. (a) A person commits an offense if, while_  
| _intoxicated, the person carries a firearm, including a handgun or_  
| _long gun, in a public place._  
|  _(b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor._  
|  _(c)_ _____This section does not apply to a special investigator_  
| _under Article 2.122, Code of Criminal Procedure, or a peace officer_  
| _regardless of whether the special investigator or peace officer is_  
| _engaged in the actual discharge of the investigator's or officer's_  
| _duties while carrying the firearm._  
|  _(d)_ _____It is not a defense to prosecution under this section_  
| _that the actor carried a handgun under the authority of Subchapter_  
| _H, Chapter 411, Government Code._  
|  _(e)_ _____In this section, "intoxicated" has the meaning assigned_  
| _by Section 49.01._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 411.186(a), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (a) The department shall revoke a license under this section  
| if the license holder:  
|  (1) was not entitled to the license at the time it was  
| issued;  
|  (2) made a material misrepresentation or failed to  
| disclose a material fact in an application submitted under this  
| subchapter;  
|  (3) subsequently becomes ineligible for a license  
| under Section 411.172, unless the sole basis for the ineligibility  
| is that the license holder is charged with the commission of a Class  
| A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense, or of an offense  
| under Section 42.01, Penal Code, or equivalent offense, or of a  
| felony under an information or indictment;  
|  (4) is convicted of an offense under Section _46.025 or_  
| 46.035, Penal Code;  
|  (5) is determined by the department to have engaged in  
| conduct constituting a reason to suspend a license listed in  
| Section 411.187(a) after the person's license has been previously  
| suspended twice for the same reason; or  
|  (6) submits an application fee that is dishonored or  
| reversed if the applicant fails to submit a cashier's check or money  
| order made payable to the "Department of Public Safety of the State  
| of Texas" in the amount of the dishonored or reversed fee, plus $25,  
| within 30 days of being notified by the department that the fee was  
| dishonored or reversed.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 411.198(b), Government Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) It is a defense to prosecution under Section _46.025 or_  
| 46.035, Penal Code, that the actor, at the time of the commission of  
| the offense, was the holder of an alias license issued under this  
| section.

|  (c) Any judgment of conviction entered by any court for an  
| offense under Section _46.025 or_ 46.035, Penal Code, _committed by a_  
| _license holder_ must contain the handgun license number of the  
| convicted license holder. A certified copy of the judgment is  
| conclusive and sufficient evidence to justify revocation of a  
| license under Section 411.186(a)(4).  
|  SECTION 5. Section 46.035(d), Penal Code, is repealed.  
|  SECTION 6. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  An  
| offense committed before the effective date of this Act is governed  
| by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  For purposes of  
| this section, an offense was committed before the effective date of  
| this Act if any element of the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 7. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

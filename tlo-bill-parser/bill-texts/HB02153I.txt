|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a single local use tax rate as an alternative to  
| combined local use tax rates for computing the amount of local use  
| taxes remote sellers are required to collect and to the allocation  
| of tax revenue collected at that rate.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The purpose of this Act is to provide an  
| optional, simplified means of computing the amount of local use tax  
| remote sellers are required to collect following the decision of  
| the United States Supreme Court in _South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc._ ,  
| 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018).  
|  SECTION 2. Subchapter C, Chapter 151, Tax Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 151.0595 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___151.0595._ _____SINGLE LOCAL TAX RATE FOR REMOTE SELLERS._  
| _(a)_ ___In this section, "remote seller" means a seller whose only_  
| _activities in this state are described by Section 151.107(a)(4) or_  
| _(5)._  
|  _(b)_ _____A remote seller required to collect and remit one or_  
| _more local use taxes in connection with a sale of a taxable item_  
| _made by the remote seller shall compute the amount to collect and_  
| _remit using:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the combined rate of all applicable local use_  
| _taxes authorized or governed by Title 3; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____at the remote seller's election, the single local_  
| _use tax rate published in the Texas Register as required by_  
| _Subsection (d)._  
|  _(c)_ _____A remote seller who elects under Subsection (b)(2) to_  
| _use the single local use tax rate shall notify the comptroller of_  
| _the election before using that rate. The election applies to all_  
| _sales of taxable items made by the remote seller unless the remote_  
| _seller revokes the election by notifying the comptroller. Notice to_  
| _the comptroller under this subsection must be in the form and manner_  
| _provided by the comptroller._  
|  _(d)_ _____The single local use tax rate effective in a calendar_  
| _year is equal to the estimated average rate of local sales and use_  
| _taxes imposed in this state during the preceding state fiscal year,_  
| _as determined under Subsection (e). Before the beginning of a_  
| _calendar year, the comptroller shall publish in the Texas Register_  
| _notice of the single local use tax rate that will be in effect for_  
| _that calendar year._  
|  _(e)_ _____As soon as practicable after the end of a state fiscal_  
| _year, the comptroller shall determine the estimated average rate of_  
| _local sales and use taxes imposed in this state during the preceding_  
| _state fiscal year by:_  
|  _(1)_ _____dividing the total amount of net local sales and_  
| _use taxes remitted to the comptroller under this section and Title 3_  
| _during that state fiscal year by the total amount of net state sales_  
| _and use taxes remitted to the comptroller under this chapter during_  
| _that state fiscal year;_  
|  _(2)_ _____multiplying the amount computed under Subdivision_  
| _(1) by the rate provided by Section 151.051; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____rounding the amount computed under Subdivision (2)_  
| _to the nearest .0025._  
|  _(f)_ _____Notwithstanding Section 111.104(b), a purchaser may_  
| _annually apply for a refund of any amount by which the amount of use_  
| _tax computed using the rate described by Subsection (b)(2) and paid_  
| _by the purchaser exceeds the amount the purchaser would have paid if_  
| _that tax had been computed using the rate described by Subsection_  
| _(b)(1)._ ___The comptroller may adopt rules regarding the procedure_  
| _and proof required for the refund._  
|  _(g)_ _____A person storing, using, or consuming in this state a_  
| _taxable item purchased from a remote seller is not liable for any_  
| _additional amount of local use tax authorized or governed by Title 3_  
| _if the remote seller elects under Subsection (b)(2) to use the_  
| _single local use tax rate and the person pays to the remote seller_  
| _the amount of local use tax computed on the purchase using the_  
| _single local use tax rate._  
|  _(h)_ _____The comptroller shall administer, collect, and enforce_  
| _local use taxes computed using the single local use tax rate._  
|  _(i)_ _____The comptroller shall apportion and distribute revenue_  
| _from local use taxes computed using the single local use tax rate as_  
| _provided by Section 403.107, Government Code._  
|  _(j)_ _____The comptroller may adopt rules to administer this_  
| _section._

| taxes governed by any provision of Title 3 _,_ [ ~~of the~~ ] Tax Code, to  
| each eligible taxing unit _. The comptroller shall determine each_  
| _eligible taxing unit's share of the money held in trust from_

| _percentage computed under this subsection for the eligible taxing_  
| _unit_ [ ~~and shall apply that percentage~~ ] to the total _amount held in_

|  ~~under this section, or an allocation made under this section~~ ] with  
| other _money_ [ ~~trust or suspense accounts~~ ] held for that taxing unit  
| [ ~~or other allocations made to that taxing unit under Title 3 of the~~  
|  ~~Tax Code~~ ].

|  AN ACT  
| relating to the duties of a magistrate to inform an arrested person  
| of consequences of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 15.17(a), Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) In each case enumerated in this Code, the person making  
| the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall  
| without unnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the  
| person is arrested, take the person arrested or have _the person_  
| _arrested_ [ ~~him~~ ] taken before some magistrate of the county where the  
| _person_ [ ~~accused~~ ] was arrested or, to provide more expeditiously to  
| the person arrested the warnings described by this article, before  
| a magistrate in any other county of this state. The _person_  
| arrested [ ~~person~~ ] may be taken before the magistrate in person or  
| the image of the _person_ arrested [ ~~person~~ ] may be presented to the  
| magistrate by means of a videoconference. The magistrate shall  
| inform in clear language the person arrested, either in person or  
| through a videoconference, of the accusation against _the person_  
| [ ~~him~~ ] and [ ~~of~~ ] any affidavit filed therewith _and of the
person's_  
| _rights_ [ ~~, of his right~~ ] to retain counsel, [ ~~of his right~~ ] to
remain  
| silent, [ ~~of his right~~ ] to have an attorney present during any  
| interview with peace officers or attorneys representing the state,  
| [ ~~of his right~~ ] to terminate the interview at any time, and [ ~~of
his~~  
|  ~~right~~ ] to have an examining trial. _The magistrate shall inform the_  
| _person arrested that a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for the_  
| _offense charged may affect the person's eligibility for enlistment_  
| _or reenlistment in the United States armed forces or may result in_  
| _the person's discharge from the United States armed forces if the_  
| _person is a member of the armed forces._ The magistrate shall also  
| inform the person arrested of the person's right to request the  
| appointment of counsel if the person cannot afford counsel. The  
| magistrate shall inform the person arrested of the procedures for  
| requesting appointment of counsel. If the person _arrested_ does not  
| speak and understand the English language or is deaf, the  
| magistrate shall inform the person in a manner consistent with  
| Articles 38.30 and 38.31, as appropriate. The magistrate shall  
| ensure that reasonable assistance in completing the necessary forms  
| for requesting appointment of counsel is provided to the person at  
| the same time. If the person arrested is indigent and requests  
| appointment of counsel and if the magistrate is authorized under  
| Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the  
| county, the magistrate shall appoint counsel in accordance with  
| Article 1.051. If the magistrate is not authorized to appoint  
| counsel, the magistrate shall without unnecessary delay, but not  
| later than 24 hours after the person arrested requests appointment  
| of counsel, transmit, or cause to be transmitted to the court or to  
| the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint  
| counsel in the county, the forms requesting the appointment of  
| counsel. The magistrate shall also inform the person arrested that  
| _the person_ [ ~~he~~ ] is not required to make a statement and that any  
| statement made by _the person_ [ ~~him~~ ] may be used against _the person_  
| [ ~~him~~ ]. The magistrate shall allow the person arrested reasonable  
| time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall, after  
| determining whether the person is currently on bail for a separate  
| criminal offense, admit the person arrested to bail if allowed by  
| law. A record of the communication between the _person_ arrested  
| [ ~~person~~ ] and the magistrate shall be made. The record shall be  
| preserved until the earlier of the following dates: (1) the date  
| on which the pretrial hearing ends; or (2) the 91st day after the  
| date on which the record is made if the person is charged with a  
| misdemeanor or the 120th day after the date on which the record is  
| made if the person is charged with a felony. For purposes of this  
| subsection, "videoconference" means a two-way electronic  
| communication of image and sound between the _person_ arrested  
| [ ~~person~~ ] and the magistrate and includes secure Internet  
| videoconferencing.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

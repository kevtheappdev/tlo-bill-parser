|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to conservatorship of a child in certain suits affecting  
| the parent-child relationship.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 153.004(b), (d), (e), and (f), Family  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) The court may not appoint joint managing conservators if  
| _clear and convincing_ [ ~~credible~~ ] evidence is presented of a history  
| or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual  
| abuse by one parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or  
| a child, including a sexual assault in violation of Section 22.011  
| or 22.021, Penal Code, that results in the other parent becoming  
| pregnant with the child. A history of sexual abuse includes a  
| sexual assault that results in the other parent becoming pregnant  
| with the child, regardless of the prior relationship of the  
| parents. It is a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a  
| parent as the sole managing conservator of a child or as the  
| conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary  
| residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if  
| _clear and convincing_ [ ~~credible~~ ] evidence is presented of a history  
| or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual  
| abuse by that parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or  
| a child.  
|  (d) The court may not allow a parent to have access to a  
| child for whom it is shown by _clear and convincing_ [ ~~a preponderance~~  
|  ~~of the~~ ] evidence that:  
|  (1) there is a history or pattern of committing family  
| violence during the two years preceding the date of the filing of  
| the suit or during the pendency of the suit; or  
|  (2) the parent engaged in conduct that constitutes an  
| offense under Section 21.02, 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code,  
| and that as a direct result of the conduct, the victim of the  
| conduct became pregnant with the parent's child.  
|  (e) It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best  
| interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised visitation  
| with the child if _clear and convincing_ [ ~~credible~~ ] evidence is  
| presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect  
| or abuse or family violence by:  
|  (1) that parent; or  
|  (2) any person who resides in that parent's household  
| or who is permitted by that parent to have unsupervised access to  
| the child during that parent's periods of possession of or access to  
| the child.  
|  (f) In determining under this section whether there is _clear_  
| _and convincing_ [ ~~credible~~ ] evidence of a history or pattern of past  
| or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by a parent or  
| other person, as applicable, the court shall consider whether a  
| protective order was rendered under Chapter 85, Title 4, against  
| the parent or other person during the two-year period preceding the  
| filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, including a suit  
| for modification, pending before a court on or filed on or after the  
| effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

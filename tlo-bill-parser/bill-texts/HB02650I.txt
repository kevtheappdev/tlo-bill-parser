|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the procedure for the sale by auction of real property  
| pursuant to foreclosure of a tax lien.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 34.01(b) and (p), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) On receipt of an order of sale of real property, the  
| officer charged with selling the property shall endorse on the  
| order the date and exact time when the officer received the order.  
| The endorsement is a levy on the property without necessity for  
| going upon the ground. The officer shall calculate the total amount  
| due under the judgment, including all taxes, penalties, and  
| interest, plus any other amount awarded by the judgment, court  
| costs, and the costs of the sale. The costs of a sale include the  
| costs of advertising, _a licensed auctioneer's commission and fees,_  
| and deed recording fees anticipated to be paid in connection with  
| the sale of the property. To assist the officer in making the  
| calculation, the collector of any taxing unit that is party to the  
| judgment may provide the officer with a certified tax statement  
| showing the amount of the taxes included in the judgment that remain  
| due that taxing unit and all penalties, interest, and attorney's  
| fees provided by the judgment as of the date of the proposed sale.  
| If a certified tax statement is provided to the officer, the officer  
| shall rely on the amount included in the statement and is not  
| responsible or liable for the accuracy of the applicable portion of  
| the calculation. A certified tax statement is not required to be  
| sworn to and is sufficient if the tax collector or the collector's  
| deputy signs the statement.  
|  (p) Except as provided by Subsection (o), property seized  
| under Subchapter E, Chapter 33, may not be sold for an amount that  
| is less than the lesser of the market value of the property as  
| specified in the warrant or the total amount of taxes, penalties,  
| interest, costs, _auctioneer's commission and fees,_ and other claims  
| for which the warrant was issued. If a sufficient bid is not  
| received by the officer making the sale, the officer shall bid off  
| the property to a taxing unit in the manner specified by Subsection  
| (j) and subject to the other provisions of that subsection. A  
| taxing unit that takes title to property under this subsection  
| takes title for the use and benefit of that taxing unit and all  
| other taxing units that established tax liens in the suit or that,  
| on the date of the seizure, were owed delinquent taxes on the  
| property.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| the sale of real property under Section 34.01, Tax Code, for which  
| notice is given on or after the effective date of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

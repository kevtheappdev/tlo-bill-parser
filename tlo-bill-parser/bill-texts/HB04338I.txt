| _property and determined the market value of the property for the tax_  
| _year, an appraisal office may increase the appraised value of a_  
| _parcel of commercial real property for a tax year to an amount not_  
| _to exceed the lesser of:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the market value of the property for the most_  
| _recent tax year that the market value was determined by the_  
| _appraisal office; or_  
|  _(2) the sum of:_

| _or by wind or water damage. For purposes of appraising the property_  
| _under Subsection (c) in the tax year in which the structure would_

| Regular Session, 2019, to authorize the legislature to limit  
| increases in the appraised value of commercial real property for ad  
| valorem tax purposes to 10 percent or more of the appraised value of  
| the property for the preceding tax year is approved by the voters.  
| If that amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no  
| effect.

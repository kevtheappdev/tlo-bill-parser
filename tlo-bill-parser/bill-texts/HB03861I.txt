| relating to state funding and accountability provisions applicable  
| to school district campuses and programs operated under school  
| district and charter partnerships.

|  SECTION 1. Section 11.157, Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 11.157. CONTRACTS FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. _(a)_ The  
| board of trustees of an independent school district may contract  
| with a public or private entity for that entity to provide  
| educational services for the district.  
|  _(b)_ _____If the board of trustees of a school district grants a_  
| _campus program charter as provided by Section 12.052 and contracts_  
| _with an entity that has been awarded a charter under Section_

|  SECTION 2. Section 11.174, Education Code, is amended by  
| amending Subsection (f) and adding Subsection (f-1) to read as

|  (f) This subsection applies only to a district campus  
| subject to a contract described by Subsection (a) that received an  
| overall performance rating of unacceptable under Subchapter C,  
| Chapter 39, for the school year before operation of the district  
| campus under the contract began.  The commissioner may not impose a  
| sanction or take action against the campus under Section _39A.101_  
| [ ~~39.107(a) or (e)~~ ] for failure to satisfy academic performance  
| standards during the first two school years of operation of a  
| district campus under Subsection (a).  The overall performance  
| rating received by the campus during those first two school years is  
| not included in calculating consecutive school years and is not  
| considered a break in consecutive school years under Section  
| _39A.101_ [ ~~39.107(a) or (e)~~ ].  
|  _(f-1)_ _____Subsection (f) does not affect the applicability of_  
| _Section 39A.111 to the campus, and the performance rating received_  
| _by the campus during those first two school years is included in_  
| _calculating consecutive school years for purposes of that section._  
| _A campus that, as a result of the exemption from intervention, is_  
| _not required to submit a campus turnaround plan after two_  
| _consecutive school years of unacceptable performance is subject to_  
| _Section 39A.111 as if the campus submitted a plan at the time that_  
| _the plan would have otherwise been required._  
|  SECTION 3. Sections 42.2511(a) and (b), Education Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) This section applies only to:  
|  (1) a school district and an open-enrollment charter  
| school that enter into a contract to operate a district campus as  
| provided by Section 11.174; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (2) a charter granted by a school district for a  
| program operated by an entity that has entered into a contract under  
| Section 11.174, provided that the district does not appoint a  
| majority of the governing body of the charter holder _; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____a school district that contracts with an entity to_  
| _operate a campus program as provided by Section 11.157(b)_.  
|  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or  
| Chapter 41, a school district subject to this section is entitled to  
| receive for each student in average daily attendance at the campus  
| _or program_ described by Subsection (a) an amount equivalent to the  
| difference, if the difference results in increased funding,  
| between:  
|  (1) the amount described by Section 12.106; and  
|  (2) the amount to which the district would be entitled  
| under this chapter.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act applies beginning with the 2019-2020  
| school year.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

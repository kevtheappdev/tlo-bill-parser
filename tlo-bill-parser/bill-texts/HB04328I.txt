|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to certain property tax lenders, property tax loans, and  
| tax liens.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 32.06, Tax Code, is amended by amending  
| Subsections (a-2), (d), (f-1), and (h) to read as follows:  
|  (a-2) Except as provided by Subsection (a-8), a tax lien may  
| be transferred to the person who pays the taxes on behalf of the  
| property owner under the authorization described by Subsection  
| (a-1) for:  
|  (1) taxes that are delinquent at the time of payment;  
| or  
|  (2) taxes that are due but not delinquent at the time  
| of payment if the property:  
|  (A) is not subject to a recorded mortgage lien;  
| or  
|  (B) is subject to a recorded mortgage lien  
| provided the person who pays the taxes on behalf of the property  
| owner under the authorization pays the taxes not earlier than  
| January 31st of the year following the year in which the taxes were  
| imposed.  
|  (d) A transferee shall record [a tax lien transferred as  
| provided by this section with] the certified statement attesting to  
| the transfer of the tax lien as described by Subsection (b) in the  
| deed records of each county in which the property encumbered by the  
| lien is located. The transferee is not required to record in the  
| deed records of a county the sworn document filed under Subsection  
| (a-1)(1), but the transferee shall retain a copy of that sworn  
| document in its records.  
|  (f-1) If an obligation secured by a preexisting first lien  
| on the property is delinquent for at least 90 consecutive days and  
| the obligation has been referred to a collection specialist, the  
| mortgage servicer or the holder of the first lien may send a notice  
| of the delinquency to the transferee of a tax lien. The mortgage  
| servicer or the first lienholder is entitled, within six months  
| after the date on which that notice is sent, to obtain a release of  
| the transferred tax lien by paying the transferee of the tax lien  
| the amount of the unpaid principal, fees, and interest owed under  
| the contract between the property owner and the transferee that are  
| directly attributable to the property taxes paid by the transferee  
| or the transferee's predecessor in interest on the specific real  
| property subject to the preexisting first lien. The Finance  
| Commission of Texas by rule shall prescribe the form and content of  
| the notice under this subsection.  
|  (h) A mortgage servicer who pays a property tax loan secured  
| by a tax lien transferred under this section becomes subrogated to  
| all rights in the lien. A tax lien transferee who pays the amount  
| owed under an existing property tax loan of another property tax  
| lender becomes subrogated to all rights in the tax lien if;  
|  (1) the existing property tax lender executes an  
| assignment of the tax lien; and  
|  (2) the assignment is recorded in the deed records of  
| each county in which the property encumbered by the lien is located.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 351.0021(a), Finance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (a) The contract between a property tax lender and a  
| property owner may require the property owner to pay the following  
| costs after closing:  
|  (1) a reasonable fee for filing the release of a tax  
| lien authorized under Section 32.06(b), Tax Code;  
|  (2) a reasonable fee for a payoff statement authorized  
| under Section 32.06(f-3), Tax Code;  
|  (3) a reasonable fee for providing information  
| regarding the current balance owed by the property owner authorized  
| under Section 32.06(g), Tax Code;  
|  (4) reasonable and necessary attorney's fees,  
| recording fees, and court costs for actions that are legally  
| required to respond to a suit filed under Chapter 33, Tax Code, [or]  
| to perform a foreclosure, or in the collection of a delinquent loan,  
| including fees required to be paid to an official and fees for an  
| attorney ad litem;  
|  (5) to the extent permitted by the United States  
| Bankruptcy Code, attorney's fees and court costs for services  
| performed after the property owner files a voluntary bankruptcy  
| petition;  
|  (6) a reasonable fee for title examination and  
| preparation of an abstract of title by an attorney, a title company,  
| or a property search company authorized to do business in this  
| state;  
|  (7) a processing fee for insufficient funds, as  
| authorized under Section 3.506, Business & Commerce Code;  
|  (8) a fee for collateral protection insurance, as  
| authorized under Chapter 307;  
|  (9) a prepayment penalty, unless the lien transferred  
| is on residential property owned and used by the property owner for  
| personal, family, or household purposes;  
|  (10) recording expenses incurred in connection with a  
| modification necessary to preserve a borrower's ability to avoid a  
| foreclosure proceeding; and  
|  (11) fees for copies of transaction documents  
| requested by the property owner.  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter A, Chapter 351, Finance Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 351.0024 to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 351.0024. AFFILIATION WITH LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER. A  
| property tax lender may not, and an owner, employee, or agent of a  
| property tax lender may not, have an economic or beneficial  
| interest in, or receive any form of consideration other than the  
| provision of legal services directly or indirectly from, an  
| individual or entity that provides legal services to the property  
| tax lender relating to loan document production or review, loan  
| servicing, loan enforcement, loan foreclosure, or the collection of  
| the loan.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution.  If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

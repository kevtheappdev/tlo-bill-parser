| (e-3) to read as follows:  
|  (e) A license issued under this chapter is not transferable

| residential operation meets all requirements related to the new  
| location.  
|  _(e-3)_ _____A change in location of a school-age program operated_  
| _exclusively during the summer period or any other time when school_  
| _is not in session does not automatically revoke the license to_  
| _operate the school-age program. A school-age program that changes_  
| _location may not operate at the new location unless the department_  
| _approves the new location after the school-age program meets all_  
| _requirements related to the new location._

| Commission, in collaboration with stakeholders, shall establish a  
| closure plan for the Austin State Supported Living Center. The plan  
| must provide for closure of the facility and operations of the  
| Austin State Supported Living Center not later than August 31,  
| 2024.  
|  (b) The Health and Human Services Commission shall  
| transition as many individuals to the community as possible, while  
| maintaining respect for resident choice. The closure plan must  
| provide procedures to transition individuals using all available  
| placements, including access to placement under a home and  
| community-based services (HCS) waiver program, intermediate care  
| facility, or other state supported living center. The Health and  
| Human Services Commission must involve in the planning process  
| community providers, residents, individuals with an intellectual  
| or developmental disability who are receiving home and  
| community-based (HCS) waiver services, and other stakeholders.  
|  (c) The Health and Human Services Commission shall develop a  
| plan, in collaboration with a representative of the Austin State  
| Supported Living Center employees, to transition current employees  
| to other employment. The Health and Human Services Commission may  
| award one-time retention bonuses to each direct support  
| professional, qualified intellectual disability professional,  
| social worker, and case manager who agrees to continue to provide  
| services at the Austin State Supported Living Center until the  
| center is closed.  
|  (d) Any proceeds from the closure, including from the sale  
| or lease of facilities or other property, may be appropriated only  
| for services for persons with intellectual and developmental  
| disabilities, including persons with a dual diagnosis of  
| intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental illness.  
|  (e) Not later than August 31, 2025, the Health and Human  
| Services Commission, in collaboration with stakeholders, shall  
| evaluate the closure process, including how well the closure plan  
| worked and outcomes for residents transitioned, and, if  
| appropriate, shall develop recommended policies for future  
| closures of other state supported living centers.  
|  SECTION 2. EXPIRATION.  This Act expires August 31, 2025.  
|  SECTION 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect  
| immediately if it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members  
| elected to each house, as provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas  
| Constitution. If this Act does not receive the vote necessary for  
| immediate effect, this Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

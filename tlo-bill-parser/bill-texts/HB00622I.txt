|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a temporary limitation on the total amount of ad valorem  
| taxes that may be imposed by a taxing unit on a residence homestead  
| rendered uninhabitable or unusable as a result of a natural  
| disaster.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter B, Chapter 11, Tax Code, is amended by  
| adding Section 11.262 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___11.262._ _____LIMITATION OF TAX ON HOMESTEADS DAMAGED IN_  
| _DISASTER AREA. (a) In this section, "residence homestead" has the_  
| _meaning assigned by Section 11.13._  
|  _(b)_ _____This section applies only to a residence homestead that_  
| _is:_  
|  _(1)_ _____located in an area declared by the governor to be a_  
| _disaster area following a natural disaster; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____rendered uninhabitable or unusable as a result of_  
| _the disaster._  
|  _(c)_ _____A taxing unit may not increase during the period_  
| _prescribed by Subsection (d) the total annual amount of ad valorem_  
| _taxes the taxing unit imposes on a residence homestead above the_  
| _amount of the taxes the taxing unit imposed on the residence_  
| _homestead for the tax year in which the residence homestead was_  
| _rendered uninhabitable or unusable as a result of a natural_  
| _disaster if:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the owner of the residence homestead submits an_  
| _application for the limitation to the chief appraiser of the_  
| _appraisal district in which the residence homestead is located not_  
| _later than the first anniversary of the date the residence_  
| _homestead is rendered uninhabitable or unusable; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____the chief appraiser determines that the residence_  
| _homestead was rendered uninhabitable or unusable as a result of the_  
| _natural disaster._  
|  _(d) The limitation provided by this section:_  
|  _(1)_ _____takes effect on January 1 of the first tax year_  
| _following the tax year in which the natural disaster that renders_  
| _the residence homestead uninhabitable or unusable occurs; and_  
|  _(2) expires on January 1 of the earlier of:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the first tax year following the tax year in_  
| _which the fifth anniversary of the natural disaster occurs; or_  
|  _(B)_ _____the first tax year in which the property no_  
| _longer qualifies as the residence homestead of:_  
|  _(i)_ _____the property owner claiming the_  
| _limitation under this section; or_  
|  _(ii)_ _____the surviving spouse of the property_  
| _owner if the surviving spouse is entitled to the limitation under_  
| _this section._  
|  _(e)_ _____If a property owner who qualifies for a limitation under_  
| _this section dies, the surviving spouse of the owner is entitled to_  
| _the limitation for the residence homestead of the owner for the_  
| _period prescribed by Subsection (d) if the residence homestead:_  
|  _(1)_ _____is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse_  
| _on the date that the owner dies; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____remains the residence homestead of the surviving_  
| _spouse._  
|  _(f)_ _____This subsection applies only if a property owner submits_  
| _an application under this section to the chief appraiser after the_  
| _tax year in which the natural disaster occurs that renders the_  
| _owner's residence homestead uninhabitable or unusable, the chief_  
| _appraiser approves the application, and the taxes imposed by a_  
| _taxing unit on the residence homestead for that tax year are greater_  
| _than the taxes imposed by the taxing unit for the preceding tax_  
| _year. If the tax bill for the current tax year has been mailed and_  
| _the tax on the residence homestead has not been paid, the assessor_  
| _shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in whose name the_  
| _residence homestead is listed on the tax roll or to the person's_  
| _authorized agent. If the tax on the residence homestead for the_  
| _current tax year has been paid, the tax collector for the taxing_  
| _unit shall refund to the person who paid the tax the amount by which_  
| _the payment exceeded the tax due._  
|  _(g)_ _____For each school district in an appraisal district, the_  
| _chief appraiser shall determine the portion of the appraised value_  
| _of residence homesteads of individuals on which school district_  
| _taxes are not imposed in a tax year because of the limitation on tax_  
| _increases under this section. That portion is calculated by_  
| _determining the taxable value that, if multiplied by the tax rate_  
| _adopted by the school district for the tax year, would produce an_  
| _amount equal to the amount of tax that would have been imposed by_  
| _the school district on those homesteads if the limitation on tax_  
| _increases under this section were not in effect, but that was not_  
| _imposed because of that limitation. The chief appraiser shall_  
| _determine that taxable value and certify it to the comptroller as_  
| _soon as practicable for each tax year._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 23.19(b) and (g), Tax Code, are amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  (b) If an appraisal district receives a written request for  
| the appraisal of real property and improvements of a cooperative  
| housing corporation according to the separate interests of the  
| corporation's stockholders, the chief appraiser shall separately  
| appraise the interests described by Subsection (d) if the  
| conditions required by Subsections (e) and (f) have been met.  
| Separate appraisal under this section is for the purposes of  
| administration of tax exemptions, determination of applicable  
| limitations of taxes under Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261, _or 11.262,_  
| and apportionment by a cooperative housing corporation of property  
| taxes among its stockholders but is not the basis for determining  
| value on which a tax is imposed under this title. A stockholder  
| whose interest is separately appraised under this section may  
| protest and appeal the appraised value in the manner provided by  
| this title for protest and appeal of the appraised value of other  
| property.  
|  (g) A tax bill or a separate statement accompanying the tax  
| bill to a cooperative housing corporation for which interests of  
| stockholders are separately appraised under this section must  
| state, in addition to the information required by Section 31.01,  
| the appraised value and taxable value of each interest separately  
| appraised. Each exemption claimed as provided by this title by a  
| person entitled to the exemption shall also be deducted from the  
| total appraised value of the property of the corporation. The total  
| tax imposed by a _taxing unit_ [ ~~school district, county,~~  
|  ~~municipality, or junior college district~~ ] shall be reduced by any  
| amount that represents an increase in taxes attributable to  
| separately appraised interests of the real property and  
| improvements that are subject to the limitation of taxes prescribed  
| by Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~or~~ ] 11.261 _, or 11.262_. The corporation shall  
| apportion among its stockholders liability for reimbursing the  
| corporation for property taxes according to the relative taxable  
| values of their interests.

| are amended to read as follows:  
|  (6) "Current total value" means the total taxable

| exempted for the current tax year for the first time under Section  
| 11.31 or 11.315, except that:  
|  (A) the current total value for a school district  
| excludes:  
|  (i) the total value of homesteads that  
| qualify for a tax limitation as provided by Section 11.26; and  
|  (ii) new property value of property that is  
| subject to an agreement entered into under Chapter 313; [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (B) the current total value for a county,  
| municipality, or junior college district excludes the total value  
| of homesteads that qualify for a tax limitation provided by Section  
| 11.261 _applicable to the taxing unit; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____the current total value for a taxing unit_  
| _excludes the total value of homesteads that qualify for a tax_  
| _limitation provided by Section 11.262 applicable to the taxing_  
| _unit_.  
|  (13) "Last year's levy" means the total of:  
|  (A) the amount of taxes that would be generated  
| by multiplying the total tax rate adopted by the governing body in  
| the preceding year by the total taxable value of property on the  
| appraisal roll for the preceding year, including:  
|  (i) taxable value that was reduced in an  
| appeal under Chapter 42; and  
|  (ii) all appraisal roll supplements and  
| corrections other than corrections made pursuant to Section  
| 25.25(d), as of the date of the calculation, except that last year's  
| taxable value for a school district excludes the total value of  
| homesteads that qualified for a tax limitation as provided by  
| Section 11.26 _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] last year's taxable value for a county,  
| municipality, or junior college district excludes the total value  
| of homesteads that qualified for a tax limitation as provided by  
| Section 11.261 _applicable to the taxing unit, and last year's_  
| _taxable value for a taxing unit excludes the total value of_  
| _homesteads that qualified for a tax limitation as provided by_  
| _Section 11.262 applicable to the taxing unit_ ; and  
|  (B) the amount of taxes refunded by the taxing

|  _(C)_ _____last year's taxable value for a taxing unit_  
| _excludes the total value of homesteads that qualified for a tax_  
| _limitation as provided by Section 11.262 applicable to the taxing_  
| _unit_.

| Subsection (c-3) to read as follows:

| _residence homestead subject to the limitation authorized by Section_

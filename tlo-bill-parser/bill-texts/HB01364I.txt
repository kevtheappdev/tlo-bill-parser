| that the conduct engaged in was wrong at the time the conduct was  
| engaged in. The prosecution is not required to prove that the actor

| date the offense was committed or the conduct occurred, and the  
| former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For purposes of  
| this section, an offense was committed or conduct occurred before  
| the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense or  
| conduct occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 9. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

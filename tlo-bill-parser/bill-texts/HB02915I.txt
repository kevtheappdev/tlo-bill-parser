| equipment inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property  
| tax was assigned. The money shall be deposited by the collector to  
| the credit of the owner's escrow account for prepayment of property  
| taxes as provided by this section. An escrow account required by  
| this section is used to pay property taxes levied against the  
| dealer's heavy equipment inventory, and the owner shall fund the  
| escrow account as provided by this subsection.

| equipment inventory tax statement form. Each month, a dealer shall

| with the collector and indicate that no sales[ ~~, leases, or rentals~~ ]  
| were made in the prior month. A dealer shall file a copy of the  
| statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation  
| relating to the disposition of each item of heavy equipment sold  
| [ ~~and the lease or rental of each item of heavy equipment~~ ]. A chief

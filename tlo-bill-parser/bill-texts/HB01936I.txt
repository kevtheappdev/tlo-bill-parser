|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the applicability of the death penalty to a capital

|  SECTION 1. Title 1, Code of Criminal Procedure, is amended  
| by adding Chapter 46D to read as follows:  
| _CHAPTER 46D. CAPITAL CASE: EFFECT OF SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS_  
|  _Art._ ___46D.001._ _____DEFINITION. In this chapter, "person with_  
| _severe mental illness" means a person who has schizophrenia, a_  
| _schizoaffective disorder, or a bipolar disorder and, as a result of_  
| _that disorder, has active psychotic symptoms that substantially_  
| _impair the person's capacity to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____appreciate the nature, consequences, or_  
| _wrongfulness of the person's conduct; or_  
|  _(2)_ _____exercise rational judgment in relation to the_  
| _person's conduct._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.002._ _____RESTRICTION ON DEATH PENALTY. A defendant_  
| _who at the time of the commission of a capital offense was a person_  
| _with severe mental illness may not be sentenced to death._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.003._ _____HEARING; DETERMINATION. (a)_ ___The attorney_  
| _for a defendant in a capital case, not later than the 30th day_  
| _before the date trial is scheduled to begin, may request in writing_  
| _that the judge hearing the case hold a hearing to determine whether_  
| _the defendant was a person with severe mental illness at the time of_  
| _the commission of the alleged offense._  
|  _(b)_ _____A request under Subsection (a) must be accompanied by_  
| _evidence supporting the claim that the defendant was a person with_  
| _severe mental illness at the time of the commission of the alleged_  
| _offense._  
|  _(c)_ _____If the defendant does not submit the request within the_  
| _period required by Subsection (a), the judge may not hold a hearing_  
| _under this article unless the judge finds that good cause existed_  
| _for the failure to timely request the hearing._  
|  _(d)_ _____On receipt of a request under Subsection (a), the judge_  
| _shall notify the attorney representing the state of the request and_  
| _allow the attorney an opportunity to respond. If the judge finds_  
| _that the request was timely filed under Subsection (a) and was_  
| _accompanied by the supporting evidence described by Subsection (b),_  
| _the judge shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant_  
| _was a person with severe mental illness at the time of the_  
| _commission of the alleged offense._  
|  _(e)_ _____If the judge finds that the request was not timely filed_  
| _under Subsection (a) or was not accompanied by the supporting_  
| _evidence described by Subsection (b), the judge shall:_  
|  _(1) deny the defendant's request;_  
|  _(2)_ _____make written findings of fact explaining the_  
| _grounds for the denial;_  
|  _(3)_ _____provide the findings of fact to the defendant and_  
| _the attorney representing the state; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____file a copy of the findings of fact with the papers_  
| _in the case._  
|  _(f)_ _____At the conclusion of the hearing under this article, the_  
| _judge shall make the determination described by Subsection (d)._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.004._ _____BURDEN OF PROOF. At a hearing under Article_  
| _46D.003, the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence_  
| _that the defendant was a person with severe mental illness at the_  
| _time of the commission of the alleged offense._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.005._ _____EFFECT OF DETERMINATION ON SUBSEQUENT TRIAL._  
| _(a) If the judge determines after a hearing under Article 46D.003_  
| _that the defendant was a person with severe mental illness at the_  
| _time of the commission of an alleged capital offense, and the_  
| _defendant is subsequently convicted of that offense, Article 37.071_  
| _does not apply to the defendant, and the judge shall sentence the_  
| _defendant to imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal_  
| _Justice for life without parole._  
|  _(b)_ _____If the judge determines after a hearing under Article_  
| _46D.003 that the defendant was not a person with severe mental_  
| _illness at the time of the commission of an alleged capital offense,_  
| _the judge shall conduct the trial of that offense in the same manner_  
| _as if a hearing under Article 46D.003 had not been held. At the_  
| _trial of the offense the jury may not be informed of the fact that_  
| _the judge has determined that the defendant was not a person with_  
| _severe mental illness, and that determination does not prohibit the_  
| _defendant from introducing evidence of a mental disability as_  
| _otherwise permitted by law._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.006._ _____APPOINTMENT OF DISINTERESTED EXPERT. (a) On_  
| _the request of either party or on the judge's own motion, the judge_  
| _shall appoint a disinterested expert experienced and qualified in_  
| _the field of diagnosing mental illness to examine the defendant and_  
| _determine whether the defendant is a person with severe mental_  
| _illness._  
|  _(b)_ _____The judge may, after giving notice to the defendant,_  
| _order the defendant to submit to an examination by an expert_  
| _appointed under this article._  
|  _(c) An examination described by this article:_  
|  _(1)_ _____must be narrowly tailored to determine whether the_  
| _defendant has the specific disorder claimed; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____may not include an assessment of the risk of danger_  
| _the defendant may pose to any person._  
|  _(d)_ _____An expert appointed under this article must provide the_  
| _defendant's attorney with all notes and data from the examination._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.007._ _____STATEMENT NOT ADMISSIBLE. A statement made_  
| _by the defendant in a hearing or examination under this chapter may_  
| _not be admitted into evidence during the trial of the offense._  
|  _Art._ ___46D.008._ _____INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL. Neither the defendant_  
| _nor the state is entitled to make an interlocutory appeal of a_  
| _determination made under Article 46D.003._  
|  SECTION 2. Chapter 46D, Code of Criminal Procedure, as  
| added by this Act, applies only to a trial that commences on or  
| after the effective date of this Act, regardless of whether the  
| alleged offense was committed before, on, or after that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

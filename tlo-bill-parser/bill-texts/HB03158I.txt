| directive or a patient's or family's decision to choose the  
| treatment necessary to prevent the patient's death,  
| life-sustaining medical treatment will be provided until the  
| patient can be transferred to a health care provider willing to  
| honor the directive or treatment decision.

| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) If an attending physician refuses to comply with a

| _treatment to a patient_ [ ~~and does not wish to follow the procedure~~  
|  ~~established under Section 166.046~~ ], life-sustaining treatment  
| shall be provided to the patient[ ~~, but only~~ ] until [ ~~a reasonable~~  
|  ~~opportunity has been afforded for the transfer of~~ ] the patient _is_  
| _transferred_ to another physician or health care facility willing to  
| comply with the directive or treatment decision _to provide_  
| _life-sustaining treatment to the patient_.  
|  SECTION 4. Sections 166.046(a), (b), (d), (e), (e-1), and  
| (f), Health and Safety Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) If an attending physician refuses to honor a patient's  
| advance directive or a health care or treatment decision made by or  
| on behalf of a patient, _other than a directive or decision to_  
| _provide artificial nutrition and hydration to the patient,_ the  
| physician's refusal shall be reviewed by an ethics or medical  
| committee. The attending physician may not be a member of that  
| committee. The patient shall be given life-sustaining treatment  
| during the review _and until the patient is transferred to another_  
| _physician or health care facility willing to comply with the_  
| _directive or treatment decision to provide life-sustaining_  
| _treatment to the patient_.  
|  (b) The patient or the person responsible for the health  
| care decisions of the individual who has made the decision  
| regarding the directive or treatment decision:

| procedures related to this section adopted by the health care

|  ~~ordered to do so under Subsection (g), except that artificially~~ ]  
| administered nutrition and hydration must be provided unless, based  
| on reasonable medical judgment, providing artificially  
| administered nutrition and hydration would:  
|  (1) hasten the patient's death;  
|  (2) be medically contraindicated such that the  
| provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening  
| medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of  
| the treatment;

| not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of the treatment;

| within six months from the date of the _recommendations made_  
| [ ~~decision reached~~ ] during the review process conducted upon the  
| previous admission, Subsections (b) through (e) need not be  
| followed if the patient's attending physician and a consulting  
| physician who is a member of the ethics or medical committee of the  
| facility document on the patient's readmission that the patient's  
| condition either has not improved or has deteriorated since the

| treatment [ ~~until the time period provided under Subsection (e) has~~  
|  ~~expired~~ ].

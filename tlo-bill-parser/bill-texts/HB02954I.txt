|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to school district grace period policies and the provision  
| of meals to public school students with insufficient balances on  
| prepaid meal cards or in meal accounts.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 33.908, Education Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 33.908. GRACE PERIOD POLICY FOR EXHAUSTED OR  
| INSUFFICIENT MEAL CARD OR ACCOUNT BALANCE. _(a) In this section,_  
| _"regular meal" means a meal for which a school district ordinarily_  
| _receives reimbursement under the national free or reduced-price_  
| _lunch program established under 42 U.S.C. Section 1751 et seq._  
|  _(b)_ The board of trustees of a school district that allows  
| students to use a prepaid meal card or account to purchase meals  
| served at schools in the district shall adopt a grace period policy  
| regarding the use of the cards or accounts. The policy:  
|  (1) must allow a student whose meal card or account  
| balance is exhausted or insufficient to continue, for a _grace_  
| period determined by the board _of at least two weeks_ , to purchase  
| _regular_ meals by:  
|  (A) accumulating a negative balance on the  
| student's card or account; or  
|  (B) otherwise receiving an extension of credit  
| from the district;  
|  (2) must require the district to _make at least three_  
| _attempts by telephone or electronic mail during each week of the_  
| _grace period to privately:_  
|  _(A)_ notify the parent of or person standing in  
| parental relation to the student that the student's meal card or  
| account balance is exhausted;  
|  _(B)_ _____make arrangements with the parent or other_  
| _person for payment of negative balances or amounts otherwise due,_  
| _including through use of a payment plan; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____assist the parent or other person in_  
| _completing an application on behalf of the student for free or_  
| _reduced-price meals, if it is determined that the student may be_  
| _eligible for free or reduced-price meals;_  
|  (3) _must require the district to send home with the_  
| _student in an unmarked white envelope a written notice of a negative_  
| _balance or other amount due and an application for free or_  
| _reduced-price meals;_  
|  _(4)_ may not permit the district to charge a fee or  
| interest in connection with meals purchased under Subdivision (1);  
| and  
|  _(5)_ [ ~~(4)~~ ] may permit the district to set a schedule  
| for repayment on the account balance _or other amount due if the_  
| _district is unable to set a repayment schedule by agreement through_  
| _efforts required under Subdivision (2)_ [ ~~as part of the notice to the~~  
|  ~~parent or person standing in parental relation to the student~~ ].  
|  _(c)_ _____After expiration of the grace period, the school_  
| _district may:_  
|  _(1)_ _____permit the student to continue to purchase regular_  
| _meals in the manner described by Subsection (b)(1); or_  
|  _(2)_ _____provide the student with alternative meals at no_  
| _cost._  
|  _(d)_ _____A school district that elects to provide alternative_  
| _meals must:_  
|  _(1)_ _____privately notify the student's parent or person_  
| _standing in parental relation to the student of the district's_  
| _action; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____provide those meals through the same serving line_  
| _as regular meals._  
|  _(e)_ _____If a school district provides regular meals to a student_  
| _under Subsection (c)(1) and is unable at the end of the school year_  
| _to obtain payment for the meals from the student's parent or person_  
| _standing in parental relation to the student, the district may pay_  
| _the negative balance on the student's meal card or account using_  
| _private donations solicited by the district from individuals and_  
| _entities for that purpose and maintained in a separate district_  
| _account. The amount of any private donations received under this_  
| _subsection is in addition to any reimbursement to which the_  
| _district is entitled under federal law._  
|  _(f)_ _____A school district may not publicly identify a student_  
| _with a negative balance on a meal card or account and must implement_  
| _any action authorized under this section in a manner that does not_  
| _stigmatize a student or cause embarrassment. The district's policy_  
| _must identify the manner in which the district will prevent_  
| _stigmatizing a student or causing embarrassment._  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies beginning with the 2019-2020  
| school year.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the award of diligent participation credit to  
| defendants serving a sentence for a state jail felony offense.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Article 42A.559, Code of Criminal Procedure, is  
| amended by amending Subsections (b), (f), (g), and (h) and adding  
| Subsection (e-1) to read as follows:  
|  (b) A defendant _serving a sentence for_ [ ~~confined in~~ ] a state  
| jail felony _offense_ [ ~~facility~~ ] does not earn good conduct time for  
| time served _for the offense_ [ ~~in the facility~~ ] but may be awarded  
| diligent participation credit in accordance with Subsection (f) or  
| (g).  
|  _(e-1)_ _____This subsection applies only to a defendant serving a_  
| _sentence for a state jail felony offense who is confined in a county_  
| _jail before being transferred to a state jail felony facility. For_  
| _purposes of awarding diligent participation credit under_  
| _Subsection (f) or (g), the sheriff of each county shall:_  
|  _(1)_ _____record the number of days each defendant described_  
| _by this subsection diligently participated in an educational,_  
| _vocational, treatment, or work program while confined in the county_  
| _jail; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____attach a certification of the number of days_  
| _recorded under Subdivision (1) when transferring the defendant to a_  
| _state jail felony facility._  
|  (f) For a defendant with a judgment that contains a finding  
| under Article 42.0199 that the defendant is presumptively entitled  
| to diligent participation credit and who has not been the subject of  
| disciplinary action while confined _for_ [ ~~in~~ ] the state jail felony  
| _offense_ [ ~~facility~~ ], the department shall credit against any time  
| the defendant is required to serve _for the_ [ ~~in a~~ ] state jail felony  
| _offense_ [ ~~facility~~ ] additional time for each day the defendant  
| actually served [ ~~in the facility~~ ] while diligently participating in  
| an educational, vocational, treatment, or work program.  
|  (g) For a defendant with a judgment that contains a finding  
| under Article 42.0199 that the defendant is not presumptively  
| entitled to diligent participation credit or who has been the  
| subject of disciplinary action while confined _for_ [ ~~in~~ ] the state  
| jail felony _offense_ [ ~~facility~~ ], the department shall, not later  
| than the 30th day before the date on which the defendant will have  
| served 80 percent of the defendant's sentence, report to the  
| sentencing court the record of the number of days under _Subsections_  
| [ ~~Subsection~~ ] (e) _and (e-1), as applicable_. The contents of a report  
| submitted under this subsection are not subject to challenge by a  
| defendant. A judge, based on the report, may credit against any time  
| a defendant is required to serve _for the_ [ ~~in a~~ ] state jail felony  
| _offense_ [ ~~facility~~ ] additional time for each day the defendant  
| actually served [ ~~in the facility~~ ] while diligently participating in  
| an educational, vocational, treatment, or work program.  
|  (h) A time credit under Subsection (f) or (g) may not exceed  
| one-fifth of the amount of time the defendant is originally  
| required to serve _for the state jail felony offense_ [ ~~in the~~  
|  ~~facility~~ ]. A defendant may not be awarded a time credit under  
| Subsection (f) or (g) for any period during which the defendant is  
| subject to disciplinary status. A time credit under Subsection (f)  
| or (g) is a privilege and not a right.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a person serving a sentence for a state jail felony offense  
| committed on or after the effective date of this Act. A person  
| serving a sentence for a state jail felony offense committed before  
| the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect when  
| the offense was committed, and the former law is continued in effect  
| for that purpose. For purposes of this section, an offense was  
| committed before the effective date of this Act if any element of  
| the offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

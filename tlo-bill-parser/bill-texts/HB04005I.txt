|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to certification by a physical therapist of a person's  
| eligibility for license plates or parking placards issued to  
| persons with disabilities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 504.201(d), Transportation Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the initial  
| application for specialty license plates under this section must be  
| accompanied by a written statement from a physician [ ~~who is~~ ]  
| licensed to practice medicine _or physical therapist licensed to_  
| _practice physical therapy_ in this state or in a state adjacent to  
| this state or who is authorized by applicable law to practice  
| medicine _or physical therapy, as applicable,_ in a hospital or other  
| health facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  If the  
| applicant has a mobility problem caused by a disorder of the foot,  
| the written statement may be issued by a person licensed to practice  
| podiatry in this state or a state adjacent to this state.  In this  
| subsection, "podiatry" has the meaning assigned by Section 681.001.  
| The statement must certify that the person making the application  
| or on whose behalf the application is made is legally blind or has a  
| mobility problem that substantially impairs the person's ability to  
| ambulate.  The statement must also certify whether a mobility  
| problem is temporary or permanent.  A written statement is not  
| required as acceptable medical proof if:  
|  (1) the person with a disability:  
|  (A) has had a limb, hand, or foot amputated; or  
|  (B) must use a wheelchair; and  
|  (2) the applicant executes a statement attesting to  
| the person's disability before the county assessor-collector.  
|  SECTION 2. Section 681.003(c), Transportation Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) Subject to Subsections (e) and (f), the first  
| application must be accompanied by a notarized written statement or  
| written prescription of a physician licensed to practice medicine  
| _or physical therapist licensed to practice physical therapy_ in this  
| state or a state adjacent to this state, or authorized by applicable  
| law to practice medicine _or physical therapy, as applicable,_ in a  
| hospital or other health facility of the United States Department  
| of Veterans Affairs, certifying and providing evidence acceptable  
| to the department that the person making the application or on whose  
| behalf the application is made is legally blind or has a mobility  
| problem that substantially impairs the person's ability to  
| ambulate. The statement or prescription must include a  
| certification of whether the disability is temporary or permanent  
| and information acceptable to the department to determine the type  
| of disabled parking placard for which the applicant is  
| eligible. The department shall determine a person's eligibility  
| based on evidence provided by the applicant establishing legal  
| blindness or mobility impairment.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 681.004(d), Transportation Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (d) A disabled parking placard issued to a person with a  
| temporary disability expires after the period set by the department  
| and may be renewed at the end of that period if the disability  
| remains as evidenced by a physician's _or physical therapist's_  
| statement or prescription submitted as required for a first  
| application under Section 681.003(c).  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

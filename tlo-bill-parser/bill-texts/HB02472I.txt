|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 821.001, Government Code, is amended by  
| adding Subdivision (11-a) to read as follows:  
|  _(11-a)_ _____"Peace officer" means a member of the_  
| _retirement system who is elected, employed, or appointed as a peace_

| adding Subsection (e) to read as follows:  
|  _(e)_ _____For a peace officer, the withdrawal of accumulated_  
| _contributions under Subsection (a) includes all of the officer's_  
| _contributions made under Section 825.403._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 824.202, Government Code, is amended by  
| adding Subsection (g) to read as follows:  
|  _(g)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a member who is at least_  
| _55 years old and who has at least 10 years of service credit as a_  
| _peace officer engaged in law enforcement activities by a school_  
| _district or institution of higher education is eligible to retire_  
| _and receive a service retirement annuity._  
|  SECTION 4. Subchapter C, Chapter 824, Government Code, is  
| amended by adding Section 824.2035 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___824.2035._ _____SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN_  
| _PEACE OFFICERS. (a) A member who has at least 20 years of service_  
| _credit as a peace officer is eligible to retire regardless of age_  
| _and receive a standard service retirement annuity in an amount and_  
| _to be funded as provided by this section._  
|  _(b)_ _____The standard service retirement annuity payable for at_  
| _least 20 years of service credit as a peace officer is an amount_  
| _computed on the basis of the member's average annual compensation_  
| _for the five years of service, whether or not consecutive, in which_  
| _the member received the highest annual compensation, times the sum_  
| _of the percentage factor used in the computation of a standard_  
| _service retirement annuity under Section 824.203 plus 0.5 percent._  
|  _(c)_ _____The standard combined service retirement annuity that_

| _actuarially reduced by five percent for each year of difference_  
| _between the member's age at retirement and 57. The actuarial_  
| _reduction described by this section is in addition to any other_  
| _actuarial reduction required by law._

| _age and amount of peace officer service credit and other service_  
| _credit, and is not entitled to have the annuity recalculated at_  
| _normal retirement age. The standard or reduced annuity under this_

| _824.204 are available to a member eligible to receive a service_  
| _retirement annuity under this section, but the same optional plan_  
| _and beneficiary must be selected for the portion of the annuity_  
| _payable from the peace officer supplemental retirement fund and the_  
| _portion payable from appropriate accounts described by Section_  
| _825.306._  
|  _(f)_ _____The amount payable from the peace officer supplemental_  
| _retirement fund is reducible by the amount paid from appropriate_

| _officer. The total combined amount of an annuity under this section_  
| _may not be less than the authorized benefit under Subsection (b)_  
| _subtracted by any amount necessary because of selection of an_  
| _optional annuity, because of retirement before the normal_  
| _retirement age, or as provided by Subsection (g)._  
|  _(g)_ _____The standard combined service retirement annuity_  
| _payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a peace officer_  
| _may not exceed 100 percent of the average compensation computed_  
| _under Subsection (b)._  
|  _(h)_ _____For purposes of this section, service as a peace officer_

| _month-to-month basis, whichever is greater._

| _conditions that apply to other disability retirement annuities_  
| _under this subtitle, except that the source and amount of the_  
| _annuity are as provided by this section._  
|  _(b)_ _____Except as provided by Subsection (c), a disability_  
| _retirement annuity under this section is an amount, but not more_  
| _than 100 percent, computed on the basis of the officer's average_  
| _annual compensation, times a percentage derived by application of_  
| _Section 824.2035(b)._  
|  _(c)_ _____A disability retirement annuity under this section is_  
| _not reducible because of age and may not be less than 50 percent of_  
| _the officer's average annual compensation regardless of the amount_

| _from the peace officer supplemental retirement fund are the amount_  
| _remaining after deduction of any amount payable under Section_  
| _824.304, except the portion of an amount that exceeds the minimum_  
| _payments provided by Section 824.304 and that is made for service_  
| _other than as a peace officer and any amount by which an annuity is_

| _retirement annuity to 100 percent of the officer's average annual_  
| _compensation._

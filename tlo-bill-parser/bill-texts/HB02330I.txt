|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to a study of an intake system and state case management  
| system for state and federal disaster assistance.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) In this section:  
|  (1) "Commission" means the Health and Human Services  
| Commission.  
|  (2) "Division" means the Texas Division of Emergency  
| Management.  
|  (b) The commission and the division shall conduct a study to  
| determine the feasibility of developing:  
|  (1) a single intake form that would compile all  
| information needed to obtain disaster assistance from multiple  
| state and federal programs for an individual who needs assistance  
| as a result of a disaster;  
|  (2) an automated intake system for collecting the  
| information; and  
|  (3) a state case management system for disaster  
| assistance, administered by the commission, that is similar to the  
| Federal Emergency Management Agency case management system and  
| includes contracting with nonprofit vendors to hire caseworkers and  
| provide case management services.  
|  (c) The commission and the division shall coordinate with  
| the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate state  
| and federal agencies to conduct the study under Subsection (b) of  
| this section. The commission and the division must determine:  
|  (1) whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency  
| and other appropriate state and federal agencies will accept the  
| single intake form;  
|  (2) the cost of developing the single intake form and  
| the cost of developing and maintaining the automated intake system;  
| and  
|  (3) the cost of developing and maintaining a state  
| case management system and the extent to which federal  
| reimbursement is available.  
|  (d) Not later than September 1, 2020, the commission and the  
| division shall prepare and submit a written report to the  
| legislature containing the findings of the study conducted under  
| Subsection (b) of this section and any recommendations to the  
| legislature.  
|  (e) The commission and the division may implement the single  
| intake form, automated intake system, and state case management  
| system if the commission and the division determine, based on the  
| study conducted under Subsection (b) of this section, that doing so  
| will result in no additional cost to the state.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act expires January 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the authority of certain holders of a wine and beer  
| retailer's permit to manufacture and sell wine and engage in  
| certain related activities.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) the state is authorized under the Twenty-first  
| Amendment of the United States Constitution to promote the public's  
| interest in the fair, efficient, and competitive marketing of wine  
| in this state;  
|  (2) the Texas wine industry operates within the  
| traditional three-tier system of alcoholic beverage regulation  
| that has been recognized as unquestionably legitimate by the United  
| States Supreme Court in _Granholm v. Heald_ , 544 U.S. 460 (2005);  
|  (3) within the state statutes that are the basis of the  
| three-tier system there are occasional exceptions, some of which  
| have been in place for years, that do not undermine or compromise  
| the three-tier system of alcoholic beverage regulation or threaten  
| the welfare, health, peace, temperance, or safety of the people of  
| Texas;  
|  (4) the Texas wine industry is a growing segment of the  
| Texas economy, expanding opportunities for grape growers, wine  
| makers, wine wholesalers, and wine retailers, while generating more  
| excise tax and sales tax revenue every year; and  
|  (5) it is in the state's interest to encourage  
| entrepreneurial and small business development opportunities in  
| the state that will lead to new capital investment in the state,  
| create new jobs in the state, and expand the state and local tax  
| base.  
|  SECTION 2. Chapter 25, Alcoholic Beverage Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 25.15 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___25.15._ _____MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF WINE BY CERTAIN PERMIT_

| _Chapter 16 except that the permit holder may not:_

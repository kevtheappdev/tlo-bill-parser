|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the resolution of certain contract disputes through a  
| contractual appraisal process.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Chapter 154, Civil Practice and Remedies Code,  
| is amended by adding Subchapter E to read as follows:  
| _SUBCHAPTER E. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BY CONTRACTUAL APPRAISAL_  
| _PROCESS_  
|  _Sec._ ___154.101._ _____TIME FOR INVOKING APPRAISAL. A party that_  
| _receives written notice of a dispute that may be subject to a_  
| _contractual appraisal process meant to determine the amount of a_  
| _loss covered by the contract may not invoke that appraisal process_  
| _after the 60th day after the date the party receives the notice._  
|  _Sec._ ___154.102._ _____PURPOSE OF APPRAISAL; OTHER DUTIES NOT_  
| _AFFECTED. (a) A party that may be liable under a contract for a loss_  
| _the amount of which may be determined through a contractual_  
| _appraisal process is required to promptly investigate and pay any_  
| _obligation under the contract, notwithstanding the existence of the_  
| _appraisal provision in the contract._  
|  _(b)_ _____A contractual appraisal process does not serve any_  
| _purpose other than the resolution of a dispute regarding the amount_  
| _of a covered loss that must be paid under the contract. The_  
| _appraisal process does not absolve a party from a statutory or_  
| _common law obligation to timely investigate and pay a contractual_  
| _obligation in good faith or exempt a party from the prompt payment_  
| _of penalties or attorney's fees ordinarily recoverable when a party_  
| _fails to adequately and timely pay a covered loss._  
|  _Sec._ ___154.103._ _____AMOUNT RECOVERABLE. A party that prevails in_  
| _a contractual appraisal process is entitled to establish the amount_  
| _that must be paid under the contract for the covered loss, which may_  
| _include reasonable attorney's fees and the cost of investigators or_  
| _appraisers._  
|  _Sec._ ___154.104._ _____CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAW. This subchapter_  
| _controls over any other law to the extent of a conflict._  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a contract entered into or renewed on or after the effective date  
| of this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

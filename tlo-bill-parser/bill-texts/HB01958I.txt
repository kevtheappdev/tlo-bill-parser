| the proceeds of a contract, lease, sale or other agreement (herein  
| called "contract"), a copy of such contract and the proceedings of  
| the contracting parties will also be submitted to the Attorney  
| General. If such bonds have been authorized and such contracts made  
| in compliance with law, the Attorney General shall approve the  
| bonds and contracts, and the bonds shall then be registered by the  
| Comptroller of Public Accounts. When so approved, such bonds and  
| the contracts shall be valid and binding and shall be incontestable  
| for any cause from and after the time of such registration.

| (herein called "refunding bonds") for the purpose of refunding or  
| refinancing any outstanding bonds or notes authorized and issued by  
| the District pursuant to this Act or other law (herein called  
| "bonds") and the interest and premium, if any, thereon to maturity  
| or on any earlier redemption date specified in the resolution  
| authorizing the issuance of the refunding bonds. Such refunding  
| bonds may be issued to refund more than one series of outstanding  
| bonds, may combine the pledges of the outstanding bonds for the  
| security of the refunding bonds, or may be secured by other or  
| additional revenues. All provisions of this Act with reference to  
| the issuance of bonds, the terms and provisions thereof, their  
| approval by the Attorney General, and the remedies of the  
| bondholders shall be applicable to refunding bonds. Refunding  
| bonds shall be registered by the Comptroller upon surrender and  
| cancellation of the bonds to be refunded, but in lieu thereof, the  
| resolution authorizing the issuance of refunding bonds may provide  
| that they shall be sold and the proceeds thereof deposited at the  
| places at which the original bonds are payable, in which case the  
| refunding bonds may be issued in an amount sufficient to pay the  
| interest and premium, if any, on the original bonds to their  
| maturity date or specified earlier redemption date, and the  
| Comptroller will register them without concurrent surrender and  
| cancellation of the original bonds. The District may also refund  
| any outstanding bonds in the manner provided by any applicable  
| General Law.  
|  _(p)_ All bonds issued by the District pursuant to the  
| provisions of this Act shall constitute investment securities  
| within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code.  
|  _(q)_ This Act, without reference to other statutes of the  
| State of Texas, shall constitute full authority for the  
| authorization and issuance of bonds hereunder, and no other Act or  
| law with regard to the authorization or issuance of obligations or  
| the deposit of the proceeds thereof, or in any impeding or  
| restricting the carrying out of the acts herein authorized to be  
| done shall be construed as applying to any proceedings taken  
| hereunder or acts done pursuant hereto.  
|  Sec. 8. _(a)_ When any of such revenues are pledged to the  
| payment of any bonds issued by said District _or loans received by_  
| _the District_ , it shall be the right and duty of the District's Board  
| of Directors to cause to be fixed, maintained and enforced charges,  
| fees or tolls for services rendered by properties and facilities,

| least sufficient to comply with and carry out the covenants and  
| provisions contained in the order or orders authorizing the  
| issuance of said bonds.

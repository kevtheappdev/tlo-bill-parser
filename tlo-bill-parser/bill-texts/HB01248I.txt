|  _(d-1)_ _____A license holder may take a credit on a return for the_  
| _period in which the purchase occurred, and a person who does not_  
| _hold a license may file a refund claim with the comptroller, if the_  
| _license holder or person paid tax on diesel fuel and the diesel fuel_  
| _is used in this state by auxiliary power units or power take-off_  
| _equipment on any motor vehicle. If the quantity of that diesel fuel_  
| _can be accurately measured while the motor vehicle is stationary by_  
| _any metering or other measuring device or method designed to_  
| _measure the fuel separately from fuel used to propel the motor_  
| _vehicle, the comptroller may approve and adopt the use of the device_  
| _as a basis for determining the quantity of diesel fuel consumed in_  
| _those operations for a tax credit or tax refund. If there is no_  
| _separate metering device or other approved measuring method, the_  
| _license holder may take the credit and the person who does not hold_  
| _a license may claim the refund on a percentage of the diesel fuel_  
| _consumed by each motor vehicle equipped with an auxiliary power_  
| _unit or power take-off equipment. The comptroller shall determine_  
| _the percentage of diesel fuel for which the credit or refund may be_  
| _claimed. The climate-control air conditioning or heating system of_  
| _a motor vehicle that has a primary purpose of providing for the_  
| _convenience or comfort of the operator or passengers is not a power_  
| _take-off system, and a credit or refund may not be allowed for the_  
| _tax paid on any portion of the diesel fuel that is used for that_  
| _purpose. A credit or refund may not be allowed for the diesel fuel_  
| _tax paid on that portion of the diesel fuel that is used for idling._  
|  _(d-2)_ _____The comptroller shall reduce the amount of the credit_  
| _or refund to which a person is otherwise entitled under Subsection_  
| _(d-1) according to the following schedule:_  
|  _(1)_ _____for fuel purchased on or after September 1, 2019,_  
| _but before January 1, 2020, the comptroller shall reduce the credit_  
| _or refund amount by 80 percent;_  
|  _(2)_ _____for fuel purchased on or after January 1, 2020, but_

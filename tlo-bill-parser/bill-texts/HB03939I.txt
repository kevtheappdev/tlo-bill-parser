|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by a common  
| carrier pipeline.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 111.019, Natural Resources Code, is  
| amended by adding Subsections (d) and (e) to read as follows:  
|  _(d)_ _____In the exercise of the power of eminent domain granted_  
| _under the provisions of Subsection (a), a common carrier shall make_  
| _a good faith effort to negotiate with the owner of property sought_  
| _to be condemned with regard to the particular route or location of_  
| _the pipeline or incidental facility on the owner's property. The_  
| _requirement to negotiate provided in this subsection:_  
|  _(1)_ _____may not be construed to allow an owner of property_  
| _to unreasonably refuse to agree to a particular route proposed by_  
| _the common carrier or to negotiate a route or location of a pipeline_  
| _or incidental facility on property not owned by the property owner;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____is presumed to be satisfied if the common carrier_  
| _or its employees, contractors, agents, or assigns contact the_  
| _property owner in person, by telephone, or through certified mail,_  
| _return receipt requested, and the property owner does not respond_  
| _before the 15th day after the date of contact._  
|  _(e)_ _____Before entering property for the purpose of making a_  
| _preliminary survey to be used in the exercise of the power of_  
| _eminent domain granted under this section, the common carrier or_  
| _its employees, contractors, agents, or assigns shall obtain from_  
| _the property owner a written authorization for the right to enter_  
| _the property. A written authorization under this subsection:_  
|  _(1)_ _____may not be unreasonably refused by a property_  
| _owner; and_  
|  _(2) must:_  
|  _(A)_ _____require notice before entering the property_  
| _under the authorization;_  
|  _(B)_ _____require the authorized access to be at a time_  
| _that is agreeable to both the common carrier and the property owner;_  
|  _(C)_ _____limit the right of entry to only the portion_  
| _of the property that is affected by the proposed pipeline;_  
|  _(D)_ _____limit the right of entry to the purpose of_  
| _conducting surveys;_  
|  _(E)_ _____prohibit the cutting, removal, or relocation_  
| _of a fence for the purpose of conducting the survey without the_  
| _prompt restoration or repair of the fence;_  
|  _(F)_ _____require the restoration of property to be as_  
| _close as possible to the original condition before entry;_  
|  _(G)_ _____require all equipment and tools used in the_  
| _survey to be removed by a certain date;_  
|  _(H)_ _____require the common carrier or its employees,_  
| _contractors, agents, or assigns to promptly repair or remediate any_  
| _damage caused by the common carrier or its employees, contractors,_  
| _agents, or assigns while on the property;_  
|  _(I)_ _____provide an indemnification provision in_  
| _favor of the property owner;_  
|  _(J)_ _____require that the property owner, on written_  
| _request, be provided, at no charge, all non-privileged information_  
| _gathered from the entry, including surveys, reports, maps, and_  
| _photographs; and_  
|  _(K)_ _____provide for an expiration date for the_  
| _authorization._  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act to Section  
| 111.019, Natural Resources Code, apply only to a condemnation  
| proceeding in which the petition is filed on or after the effective  
| date of this Act and to any property condemned through the  
| proceeding. A condemnation proceeding in which the petition is  
| filed before the effective date of this Act and any property  
| condemned through the proceeding are governed by the law in effect  
| immediately before that date, and that law is continued in effect  
| for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

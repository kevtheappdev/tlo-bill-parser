|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to departures from network adequacy standards by a  
| preferred provider benefit plan.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 1301.0055, Insurance Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  Sec. 1301.0055. NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS _; DEPARTURE FROM_  
| _STANDARDS_. _(a)_ The commissioner shall by rule adopt network  
| adequacy standards that:  
|  (1) are adapted to local markets in which an insurer  
| offering a preferred provider benefit plan operates;  
|  (2) ensure availability of, and accessibility to, a  
| full range of contracted physicians and health care providers to  
| provide health care services to insureds; and  
|  (3) on good cause shown, may allow departure from  
| local market network adequacy standards if the commissioner posts  
| on the department's Internet website the name of the preferred  
| provider plan, the insurer offering the plan, and the affected  
| local market.  
|  _(b)_ _____Unless renewed in accordance with this section,_  
| _permission to depart from a local market network adequacy standard_  
| _under this section expires on the first anniversary of the date the_  
| _commissioner grants the request for the departure._  
|  _(c)_ _____An insurer may request a renewal of permission to depart_  
| _from a local market network adequacy standard under this section_  
| _not later than the 30th day before the permission expires._  
|  _(d)_ _____If the commissioner grants an insurer's request for a_  
| _departure from a local market network adequacy standard for a_  
| _preferred provider benefit plan, the commissioner may not approve a_  
| _subsequent request by that insurer to depart from the same standard_  
| _for that plan unless the request demonstrates that:_  
|  _(1) good cause for the requested departure exists;_  
|  _(2)_ _____if a physician or health care provider able to_  
| _provide the covered service for which the insurer requests the_  
| _departure is available in the local market for which the departure_  
| _is requested:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the insurer took reasonable steps to meet the_  
| _relevant standard, including taking any steps identified in a_  
| _previous request for departure from the standard; and_  
|  _(B)_ _____for each physician or health care provider_  
| _described by this subdivision with whom the insurer does not enter a_  
| _contract:_  
|  _(i)_ _____if the failure to contract was not based_  
| _on reimbursement rates, the insurer made not less than three_  
| _reasonable attempts to negotiate the disputed contract terms; or_  
|  _(ii)_ _____if the failure to contract was based on_  
| _reimbursement rates, the insurer offered not less than three_  
| _materially different rates;_  
|  _(3)_ _____the insurer's termination of a physician or health_  
| _care provider without cause is not a contributing factor in the_  
| _insurer's need for the requested departure; and_  
|  _(4)_ _____the insurer has not had the highest ratio of claims_  
| _to mediation requests under Chapter 1467 in any of the preceding_  
| _three years for the relevant service compared to other insurers_  
| _subject to that chapter._  
|  _(e)_ _____The commissioner may impose reasonable conditions on_  
| _the grant of a departure request._  
|  SECTION 2. Not later than December 1, 2019, the  
| commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules necessary to implement  
| Section 1301.0055, Insurance Code, as amended by this Act.  
|  SECTION 3. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| an insurance policy delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed on  
| or after January 1, 2020. An insurance policy delivered, issued for  
| delivery, or renewed before January 1, 2020, is governed by the law  
| as it existed immediately before the effective date of this Act, and  
| that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

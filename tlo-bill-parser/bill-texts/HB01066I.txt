|  AN ACT  
| relating to extensions of an expired permit for the transfer of  
| groundwater from a groundwater conservation district.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 36.122, Water Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsections (j-1) and (j-2) and amending Subsection (k) to read as  
| follows:  
|  _(j-1)_ _____A district shall extend a term under Subsection (i)(2)_  
| _or (j) on or before its expiration in the manner prescribed by_  
| _Section 36.1145:_  
|  _(1)_ _____to a term that is not shorter than the term of an_  
| _operating permit for the production of water to be transferred that_  
| _is in effect at the time of the extension; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____for each additional term for which that operating_  
| _permit for production is renewed under Section 36.1145 or remains_  
| _in effect under Section 36.1146._  
|  _(j-2)_ _____A permit extended under Subsection (j-1) continues to_  
| _be subject to conditions contained in the permit as issued before_  
| _the extension._  
|  (k) Notwithstanding the period specified _under Subsection_  
| [ ~~in Subsections~~ ] (i) _,_ [ ~~and~~ ] (j) _, or (j-1)_ during which
water may be  
| transferred under a permit, a district may periodically review the  
| amount of water that may be transferred under the permit and may  
| limit the amount if additional factors considered in Subsection (f)  
| warrant the limitation, subject to Subsection (c). The review  
| described by this subsection may take place not more frequently  
| than the period provided for the review or renewal of regular  
| permits issued by the district. In its determination of whether to  
| renew a permit issued under this section, the district shall  
| consider relevant and current data for the conservation of  
| groundwater resources and shall consider the permit in the same  
| manner it would consider any other permit in the district.  
|  SECTION 2. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| the term of a permit issued under Sections 36.122(i) and (j), Water  
| Code, that expires after September 1, 2019.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

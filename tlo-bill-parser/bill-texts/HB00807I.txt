|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the state and regional water planning process.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Subchapter C, Chapter 16, Water Code, is amended  
| by adding Section 16.052 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___16.052._ _____INTERREGIONAL PLANNING COUNCIL. (a)_ ___The_  
| _board, at an appropriate time in each five-year cycle for the_  
| _adoption of a new state water plan, shall appoint an interregional_  
| _planning council. The members of the council serve until a new_  
| _state water plan is adopted._  
|  _(b)_ _____The council consists of one member of each regional_  
| _water planning group. Each regional water planning group shall_  
| _nominate one or more members for appointment to the council, and the_  
| _board shall consider the nominations in making appointments to the_  
| _council._  
|  _(c) The purposes of the council are to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____improve coordination among the regional water_  
| _planning groups, and between each regional water planning group and_  
| _the board, in meeting the goals of the state water planning process_  
| _and the water needs of the state as a whole;_  
|  _(2)_ _____facilitate dialogue regarding water management_  
| _strategies that could affect multiple regional water planning_  
| _areas; and_  
|  _(3)_ _____share best practices regarding operation of the_  
| _regional water planning process._  
|  _(d) The council shall:_  
|  _(1) hold at least one public meeting; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____prepare a report to the board on the council's_  
| _work._  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 16.053(e) and (i), Water Code, are  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (e) Each regional water planning group shall submit to the  
| development board a regional water plan that:  
|  (1) is consistent with the guidance principles for the  
| state water plan adopted by the development board under Section  
| 16.051(d);  
|  (2) provides information based on data provided or  
| approved by the development board in a format consistent with the  
| guidelines provided by the development board under Subsection (d);  
|  (2-a) is consistent with the desired future conditions  
| adopted under Section 36.108 for the relevant aquifers located in  
| the regional water planning area as of the most recent deadline for  
| the board to adopt the state water plan under Section 16.051 or, at  
| the option of the regional water planning group, established  
| subsequent to the adoption of the most recent plan; provided,  
| however, that if no groundwater conservation district exists within  
| the area of the regional water planning group, the regional water  
| planning group shall determine the supply of groundwater for  
| regional planning purposes; the Texas Water Development Board shall  
| review and approve, prior to inclusion in the regional water plan,  
| that the groundwater supply for the regional planning group without  
| a groundwater conservation district in its area is physically  
| compatible, using the board's groundwater availability models,  
| with the desired future conditions adopted under Section 36.108 for  
| the relevant aquifers in the groundwater management area that are  
| regulated by groundwater conservation districts;  
|  (3) identifies:  
|  (A) each source of water supply in the regional  
| water planning area, including information supplied by the  
| executive administrator on the amount of modeled available  
| groundwater in accordance with the guidelines provided by the  
| development board under Subsections (d) and (f);  
|  (B) factors specific to each source of water  
| supply to be considered in determining whether to initiate a  
| drought response;  
|  (C) actions to be taken as part of the response;  
| [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (D) existing major water infrastructure  
| facilities that may be used for interconnections in the event of an  
| emergency shortage of water; _and_  
|  _(E)_ _____unnecessary or counterproductive variations_  
| _in specific drought response strategies, including outdoor_  
| _watering restrictions, among user groups in the regional water_  
| _planning area that may confuse the public or otherwise impede_  
| _drought response efforts;_  
|  (4) has specific provisions for water management  
| strategies to be used during a drought of record;  
|  (5) includes but is not limited to consideration of  
| the following:  
|  (A) any existing water or drought planning  
| efforts addressing all or a portion of the region and potential  
| impacts on public health, safety, or welfare in this state;  
|  (B) approved groundwater conservation district  
| management plans and other plans submitted under Section 16.054;  
|  (C) all potentially feasible water management  
| strategies, including but not limited to improved conservation,  
| reuse, and management of existing water supplies, conjunctive use,  
| acquisition of available existing water supplies, and development  
| of new water supplies;  
|  (D) protection of existing water rights in the  
| region;  
|  (E) opportunities for and the benefits of  
| developing regional water supply facilities or providing regional  
| management of water supply facilities;  
|  (F) appropriate provision for environmental  
| water needs and for the effect of upstream development on the bays,  
| estuaries, and arms of the Gulf of Mexico and the effect of plans on  
| navigation;  
|  (G) provisions in Section 11.085(k)(1) if  
| interbasin transfers are contemplated;  
|  (H) voluntary transfer of water within the region  
| using, but not limited to, regional water banks, sales, leases,  
| options, subordination agreements, and financing agreements;  
|  (I) emergency transfer of water under Section  
| 11.139, including information on the part of each permit, certified  
| filing, or certificate of adjudication for nonmunicipal use in the  
| region that may be transferred without causing unreasonable damage  
| to the property of the nonmunicipal water rights holder; and  
|  (J) opportunities for and the benefits of  
| developing large-scale desalination facilities for:  
|  (i) marine seawater that serve local or

|  (i) The regional water planning groups shall submit their  
| adopted regional water plans to the board by January 5, 2001, for  
| approval and inclusion in the state water plan. In conjunction with  
| the submission of regional water plans, each planning group should  
| make legislative recommendations, if any, to facilitate more  
| voluntary water transfers in the region _or for any other changes_  
| _that the members of the planning group believe would improve the_  
| _water planning process_. Subsequent regional water plans shall be  
| submitted at least every five years thereafter, except that a  
| regional water planning group may elect to implement simplified  
| planning, no more often than every other five-year planning cycle,  
| and in accordance with guidance to be provided by the board, if the  
| group determines that, based on its own initial analyses using  
| updated groundwater and surface water availability information,  
| there are no significant changes to the water availability, water  
| supplies, or water demands in the regional water planning area. At  
| a minimum, simplified planning will require updating groundwater  
| and surface water availability values in the regional water plan,  
| meeting any other new statutory or other planning requirements that  
| come into effect during each five-year planning cycle, and formally  
| adopting and submitting the regional water plan for approval.  
| Public participation for revised regional plans shall follow the  
| procedures under Subsection (h).  
|  SECTION 3. The Texas Water Development Board shall appoint  
| the members of the initial interregional planning council under  
| Section 16.052, Water Code, as added by this Act, not later than  
| September 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to requiring the operator of a vehicle to stop and yield  
| the right-of-way to a pedestrian.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 552.002(b), Transportation Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) A pedestrian facing a "Walk" signal may proceed across a  
| roadway in the direction of the signal, and the operator of a  
| vehicle shall _stop and_ yield the right-of-way to the pedestrian.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 552.003(a) and (b), Transportation  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) The operator of a vehicle shall _stop and_ yield the  
| right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing a roadway in a crosswalk if:  
|  (1) no traffic control signal is in place or in  
| operation; and  
|  (2) the pedestrian is:  
|  (A) on the half of the roadway in which the  
| vehicle is traveling; or  
|  (B) approaching so closely from the opposite half  
| of the roadway as to be in danger.  
|  (b) Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a pedestrian may not  
| suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and proceed into a  
| crosswalk in the path of a vehicle so close that it is impossible  
| for the vehicle operator to _stop and_ yield.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 552.006(c), Transportation Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) The operator of a vehicle emerging from or entering an  
| alley, building, or private road or driveway shall _stop and_ yield

| extending across the alley, building entrance or exit, road, or  
| driveway.  
|  SECTION 4. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  
| An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is  
| governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed,  
| and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For  
| purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the  
| effective date of this Act if any element of the offense was  
| committed before that date.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

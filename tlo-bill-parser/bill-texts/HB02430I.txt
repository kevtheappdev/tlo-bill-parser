| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) On petition of the owner of the property, a district  
| court of the county in which an unknown cemetery is discovered or an  
| abandoned cemetery is located may order the removal of any  
| dedication for cemetery purposes that affects the property if the  
| court finds that the removal of the dedication is in the public  
| interest. If a court orders the removal of a dedication of a  
| cemetery and all human remains in that cemetery have not previously  
| been removed, the court shall order the removal of the human remains  
| from the cemetery to _:_  
|  _(1)_ a perpetual care cemetery _;_ [ ~~or~~ ]

| notice of a petition filed under Subsection (b) must be given to the  
| Texas Historical Commission and to the county historical commission

| _consult the_ Texas Historical Commission and the county historical  
| commission _in making a decision under this section_ [ ~~may intervene~~  
|  ~~and become parties to the suit~~ ]. _The court may also designate or_  
| _appoint any person, party, court appointed representative, or_  
| _official the court considers necessary to assist in determining_  
| _whether the removal is in the public interest._  
|  SECTION 3. Section 711.036(b), Health and Safety Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (b) An owner of land adjacent to a cemetery for which a  
| cemetery organization or other governing body does not exist may  
| petition a district court of the county in which the cemetery is  
| located to remove any human remains and the dedication for all or  
| any portion of the cemetery.  In addition to the notice required by  
| Section 711.004, notice of a petition filed under this subsection  
| must be given to the Texas Historical Commission and to the county  
| historical commission of the county in which the cemetery is  
| located.  The _court may consult the_ Texas Historical Commission and  
| the county historical commission _in making a decision under this_  
| _section_ [ ~~may intervene and become parties to the suit~~ ].  _The court_  
| _may also designate or appoint any person, party, court appointed_  
| _representative, or official the court considers necessary to assist_  
| _in determining whether the removal is in the public interest._  
| Unknown next of kin of deceased persons buried in the cemetery shall  
| be served by publication of a notice in a newspaper of general  
| circulation in the county in which the cemetery is located, or if  
| there is not a newspaper of general circulation in the county, in a  
| newspaper of general circulation in an adjacent county.  A  
| reasonable good faith effort shall be made to remove all remains and  
| monuments from the cemetery or that portion of the cemetery for  
| which the dedication is to be removed.  
|  SECTION 4. The changes in law made by this Act apply only to  
| a suit involving the removal of remains from an abandoned, unknown,  
| or unverified cemetery pending in a trial court on the effective  
| date of this Act or filed on or after that date. A suit involving  
| the removal of remains from an abandoned, unknown, or unverified  
| cemetery in which a final order is rendered before the effective  
| date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the  
| order was rendered, and the former law is continued in effect for  
| that purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  AN ACT  
| relating to the calculation of the ad valorem taxes imposed on  
| property for the year in which the property is acquired by a  
| governmental entity.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 26.11(a), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (a) If the federal government, the state, or a political  
| subdivision of the state acquires the right to possession of  
| taxable property under a court order issued in condemnation  
| proceedings _, takes possession of taxable property under a_  
| _possession and use agreement or under Section 21.021, Property_  
| _Code,_ or acquires title to taxable property, the amount of the tax  
| due on the property is calculated by multiplying the amount of taxes  
| imposed on the property for the entire year as determined as  
| provided by Section 26.09 of this code by a fraction, the  
| denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number  
| of days that elapsed prior to the date of the conveyance _, the_  
| _effective date of the possession and use agreement, the date the_  
| _entity took possession under Section 21.021, Property Code,_ or the  
| date of the order granting the right of possession _, as applicable_.  
|  SECTION 2. This Act applies only to a possession and use  
| agreement entered into or an award made under Section 21.021,  
| Property Code, on or after the effective date of this Act. A  
| possession and use agreement entered into or an award made under  
| Section 21.021, Property Code, before the effective date of this  
| Act is governed by the law applicable to the agreement or award  
| immediately before the effective date of this Act, and that law is  
| continued in effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

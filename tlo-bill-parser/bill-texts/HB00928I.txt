|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to establishing the Texas Climate Change Mitigation and  
| Adaptation Commission to study and address the impacts of climate  
| change in this state.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. (a) This Act shall be known as the Texas Climate  
| Change Mitigation and Adaptation Act.  
|  (b) The legislature finds that:  
|  (1) climate change is real and is the overriding  
| challenge of the 21st century;  
|  (2) climate change poses immediate and long-term  
| threats to this state's economy, sustainability, security, and way  
| of life;  
|  (3) countless scientific studies have concluded that  
| greenhouse gas emissions are a leading contributing factor to  
| global warming; and  
|  (4) addressing climate change requires a two-pronged  
| approach that includes:  
|  (A) the reduction of activities that contribute  
| to global warming; and  
|  (B) adaptations to mitigate the impacts of  
| climate change on this state.  
|  (c) The legislature further finds that:  
|  (1) on December 12, 2015, 195 countries at the 21st  
| Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework  
| Convention on Climate Change adopted an agreement addressing  
| greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance to  
| begin in the year 2020, known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris  
| Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, and is the largest  
| concerted global effort to combat climate change to date. The  
| agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle  
| of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  
| capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. Under  
| the agreement, the parties will:  
|  (A) set greenhouse gas emissions reduction  
| goals;  
|  (B) record and communicate information through a  
| transparency framework; and  
|  (C) provide support to undeveloped countries  
| through a finance mechanism; and  
|  (2) the Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global  
| response to the threat of climate change in the context of  
| sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty,  
| including by:  
|  (A) holding the increase in the global average  
| temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above preindustrial  
| levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to  
| 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to significantly  
| reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;  
|  (B) developing ways to adapt to the adverse  
| impacts of climate change and to foster climate resilience and low  
| greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not  
| threaten food production; and  
|  (C) making finance flows consistent with a  
| pathway toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient  
| development.  
|  (d) The legislature declares that:  
|  (1) notwithstanding federal action, the legislature  
| supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to combat climate change  
| and the effects of climate change on environments, economies, and  
| communities around the world;  
|  (2) this state recognizes that to promote a statewide  
| response to climate change, collaboration and cooperation are  
| needed in the following areas:  
|  (A) early warning systems;  
|  (B) emergency preparedness;  
|  (C) slow onset events;  
|  (D) events that may involve irreversible and  
| permanent loss and damage;  
|  (E) comprehensive risk assessment and  
| management;  
|  (F) risk insurance facilities, climate risk  
| pooling, and other insurance solutions;  
|  (G) noneconomic losses; and  
|  (H) resilience of communities, livelihoods, and  
| ecosystems; and  
|  (3) it is in the best interests of this state to:  
|  (A) expand strategies and mechanisms to reduce  
| greenhouse gas emissions statewide through the reduction of energy  
| use, adoption of renewable energy, and control of air pollution  
| among all governmental entities, industries, and sectors,  
| including transportation;  
|  (B) expand only the strategies and mechanisms  
| under Paragraph (A) that use the best available science,  
| technologies, and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  
| that are closely aligned with the climate change principles and  
| goals adopted in the Paris Agreement and in this state's share of  
| obligations within the expectations apportioned to the United  
| States in the agreement, notwithstanding federal action;  
|  (C) strive to formulate and communicate  
| long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies; and  
|  (D) take actions to conserve and enhance  
| long-term sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases by prioritizing  
| the development of parks and greenways, and the restoration of  
| coastal forests and wetlands.  
|  SECTION 2. The purpose of this Act is to document this  
| state's commitment to combating climate change and improving this  
| state's resilience to climate change by systematically reducing  
| greenhouse gas emissions and by aligning with the principles and  
| contributing to the goals set by the Paris Agreement through the  
| creation of the Texas Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation  
| Commission.

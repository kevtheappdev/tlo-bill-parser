|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 26.08, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsections (q) and (r) to read as follows:  
|  _(q)_ _____This subsection applies only to a school district_  
| _described by Subsection (n) whose adopted tax rate was approved at_  
| _an election under this section in the 2006 tax year or any_  
| _subsequent tax year. Notwithstanding Subsection (n), for purposes_  
| _of this section, the rollback tax rate of the school district is the_  
| _higher of:_  
|  _(1) the amount computed under Subsection (n); or_  
|  _(2) the sum of the following:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the highest maintenance and operations tax_  
| _rate adopted by the district for the 2007 tax year or any subsequent_  
| _tax year in which the adopted tax rate of the district was approved_  
| _at an election under this section; and_  
|  _(B) the district's current debt rate._  
|  _(r)_ _____Subsection (q) applies to a school district only if the_  
| _district has adopted a tax rate equal to or higher than the rate_  
| _provided by that subsection for any tax year in the preceding 10 tax_  
| _years._  
|  SECTION 2. (a)  The comptroller of public accounts shall  
| conduct a study to determine:  
|  (1) the number of school districts that adopt an ad  
| valorem tax rate for the tax year in which this Act takes effect  
| that is lower than the district's ad valorem tax rate for the tax  
| year preceding that tax year and then, for the tax year following  
| the tax year in which this Act takes effect, adopt an ad valorem tax  
| rate that is higher than the district's ad valorem tax rate for the  
| tax year in which this Act takes effect; and  
|  (2) the number of school districts that adopted an ad  
| valorem tax rate for the second tax year preceding the tax year in  
| which this Act takes effect that was lower than the district's ad  
| valorem tax rate for the tax year preceding that tax year and then,  
| for the tax year preceding the tax year in which this Act takes  
| effect, adopted an ad valorem tax rate that was higher than the  
| district's ad valorem tax rate for the second tax year preceding the  
| tax year in which this Act takes effect.  
|  (b) The comptroller of public accounts shall report the  
| results of the study conducted under this section to each member of  
| the legislature not later than December 1, 2021.  
|  SECTION 3. (a) The change in law made by this Act applies to  
| the ad valorem tax rate of a school district beginning with the 2019  
| tax year, except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section.  
|  (b) If the governing body of a school district adopted an ad  
| valorem tax rate for the school district for the 2019 tax year  
| before the effective date of this Act, the change in law made by  
| this Act applies to the ad valorem tax rate of that school district  
| beginning with the 2020 tax year, and the law in effect when the tax  
| rate was adopted applies to the 2019 tax year with respect to that  
| school district.  
|  SECTION 4. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives  
| a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as  
| provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this  
| Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this  
| Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

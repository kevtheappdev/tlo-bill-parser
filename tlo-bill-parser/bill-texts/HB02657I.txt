|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the funding soundness restoration plans required for  
| certain public retirement systems.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Sections 802.2015(c), (d), and (e), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) A public retirement system shall notify the associated  
| governmental entity in writing if the retirement system receives an  
| actuarial valuation indicating that the system's actual  
| contributions are not sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial  
| accrued liability within _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years. If a public retirement  
| system's actuarial valuation shows that the system's amortization  
| period has exceeded _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years for three consecutive annual  
| actuarial valuations, or two consecutive actuarial valuations in  
| the case of a system that conducts the valuations every two or three  
| years, the governing body of the public retirement system and the  
| associated governmental entity shall formulate a funding soundness  
| restoration plan under Subsection (e) in accordance with the  
| system's governing statute.  
|  (d) The governing body of a public retirement system and the  
| associated governmental entity that have formulated a funding  
| soundness restoration plan under Subsection (e) shall formulate a  
| revised funding soundness restoration plan under that subsection,  
| in accordance with the system's governing statute, if the system  
| conducts an actuarial valuation showing that:  
|  (1) the system's amortization period exceeds _30_ [ ~~40~~ ]  
| years; and  
|  (2) the previously formulated funding soundness  
| restoration plan has not been adhered to.  
|  (e) A funding soundness restoration plan formulated under  
| this section must:  
|  (1) be developed by the public retirement system and  
| the associated governmental entity in accordance with the system's  
| governing statute; and  
|  (2) be designed to achieve a contribution rate that  
| will be sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued  
| liability within _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years not later than the 10th anniversary  
| of the date on which the final version of a funding soundness  
| restoration plan is agreed to.  
|  SECTION 2. Sections 802.2016(c), (d), and (e), Government  
| Code, are amended to read as follows:  
|  (c) A public retirement system shall notify the associated  
| governmental entity in writing if the retirement system receives an  
| actuarial valuation indicating that the system's actual  
| contributions are not sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial  
| accrued liability within _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years. If a public retirement  
| system's actuarial valuation shows that the system's amortization  
| period has exceeded _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years for three consecutive annual  
| actuarial valuations, or two consecutive actuarial valuations in  
| the case of a system that conducts the valuations every two or three  
| years, the associated governmental entity shall formulate a funding  
| soundness restoration plan under Subsection (e) in accordance with  
| the public retirement system's governing statute.  
|  (d) An associated governmental entity that has formulated a  
| funding soundness restoration plan under Subsection (e) shall  
| formulate a revised funding soundness restoration plan under that  
| subsection, in accordance with the public retirement system's  
| governing statute, if the system conducts an actuarial valuation  
| showing that:  
|  (1) the system's amortization period exceeds _30_ [ ~~40~~ ]  
| years; and  
|  (2) the previously formulated funding soundness  
| restoration plan has not been adhered to.  
|  (e) A funding soundness restoration plan formulated under  
| this section must:  
|  (1) be developed in accordance with the public  
| retirement system's governing statute by the associated  
| governmental entity; and  
|  (2) be designed to achieve a contribution rate that  
| will be sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued  
| liability within _30_ [ ~~40~~ ] years not later than the 10th anniversary  
| of the date on which the final version of a funding soundness  
| restoration plan is formulated.  
|  SECTION 3. A public retirement system and an associated  
| governmental entity subject to Section 802.2015, Government Code,  
| as amended by this Act, or a governmental entity subject to Section  
| 802.2016, Government Code, as amended by this Act, shall formulate

| applicable section, based on the most recent actuarial valuation  
| study conducted under Section 802.101, Government Code, not later  
| than November 1, 2020.

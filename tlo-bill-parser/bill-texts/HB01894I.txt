|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the imposition of an administrative penalty and the  
| repeal of the criminal penalty for a violation of the interior  
| designers licensing law.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 1051.451, Occupations Code, is amended  
| to read as follows:  
|  Sec. 1051.451. IMPOSITION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY. _(a)_  
| _Except as provided by Subsection (b), the_ [ ~~The~~ ] board may impose an  
| administrative penalty on a person who engages in conduct for which  
| the person is subject to disciplinary action under this subtitle,  
| regardless of whether the person holds a certificate of  
| registration issued under this subtitle.  
|  _(b)_ _____The board may not impose an administrative penalty under_  
| _this subtitle on a person for conduct related to the practice of_  
| _interior design unless the person holds a certificate of_  
| _registration as an interior designer._  
|  SECTION 2. Section 1053.251(a), Occupations Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (a) On a determination that a ground for disciplinary action  
| exists under Section 1053.252, the board shall:  
|  (1) revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew a  
| certification of registration;  
|  (2) reprimand a certificate holder; or  
|  (3) impose an administrative penalty on a _certificate_  
| _holder_ [ ~~person~~ ] under Subchapter I, Chapter 1051.  
|  SECTION 3. Subchapter H, Chapter 1053, Occupations Code, is  
| repealed.  
|  SECTION 4. Sections 1051.451 and 1053.251(a), Occupations  
| Code, as amended by this Act, apply only to the imposition of an  
| administrative penalty for a violation that occurs on or after the  
| effective date of this Act. The imposition of an administrative  
| penalty for a violation that occurs before the effective date of  
| this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the violation  
| occurred, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  
|  SECTION 5. The repeal by this Act of Subchapter H, Chapter  
| 1053, Occupations Code, does not apply to an offense committed  
| under that subchapter before the effective date of the repeal.  An  
| offense committed before the effective date of the repeal is  
| governed by the law as it existed on the date the offense was  
| committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that  
| purpose.  For purposes of this section, an offense was committed  
| before the effective date of the repeal if any element of the  
| offense occurred before that date.  
|  SECTION 6. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

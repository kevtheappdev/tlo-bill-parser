| Section 311.0112 to read as follows:  
|  _Sec._ ___311.0112._ _____PROVISIONS APPLICABLE IN CERTAIN ZONES. (a)_  
| _This section applies only to a reinvestment zone:_  
|  _(1) designated by a municipality:_  
|  _(A)_ _____with a population of 1.18 million or more;_  
| _and_  
|  _(B)_ _____that is located predominantly in a county_  
| _that has a total area of less than 1,000 square miles; and_

| _central business district with:_  
|  _(A) fewer than 75,000 residents;_  
|  _(B)_ _____a median family income that is less than_  
| _$30,000 according to the last decennial census; and_  
|  _(C)_ _____an overall poverty rate that is at least two_  
| _times the poverty rate for the entire municipality that designated_  
| _the zone._  
|  _(b)_ _____For purposes of this section, an area adjacent to a_  
| _reinvestment zone means any area within two miles of the zone's_  
| _boundaries in any direction that is not located within the_  
| _boundaries of another reinvestment zone._  
|  _(c)_ _____Subject to Subsection (d), at least 20 percent of the_  
| _revenue from the tax increment fund of the reinvestment zone spent_  
| _annually must be for the development, construction, and_  
| _preservation of affordable housing in the zone and in the area_  
| _adjacent to the zone. Of that amount:_  
|  _(1)_ _____at least 75 percent must be spent to benefit_  
| _families that have a yearly income at or below 60 percent of the_  
| _area median family income, adjusted for family size; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____not more than 10 percent may be used to pay_  
| _administrative costs._  
|  _(d)_ _____Subsection (c) does not apply if the use of the revenue_  
| _in the tax increment fund in the manner required by that subsection_  
| _would materially impair the security for bonds or notes issued_  
| _under Section 311.015 before September 1, 2019._  
|  _(e)_ _____A project or reinvestment zone financing plan for a_  
| _reinvestment zone that is approved or amended on or after September_

| _development located in the zone and funded wholly or partly with_  
| _money from the tax increment fund for the zone to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____subject to Subsection (f), set aside at least 20_  
| _percent of the planned dwelling units in each residential housing_  
| _development as affordable housing with an affordability period of_  
| _at least 40 years; and_  
|  _(2)_ _____enter into a contract with the municipality that_  
| _designated the zone to pay the costs of relocating residents of the_  
| _zone and the area adjacent to the zone who are displaced as a direct_  
| _result of the residential housing development._  
|  _(f)_ _____As an alternative to the set-aside requirement under_  
| _Subsection (e)(1), the municipality that designated the_  
| _reinvestment zone may allow a developer to pay a fee to the_  
| _municipality. The amount of the fee is determined by the_  
| _municipality. The municipality shall deposit the fee in an_  
| _affordable housing fund administered by the governing body of the_  
| _municipality. Money in the fund may be used only to:_  
|  _(1)_ _____subsidize the cost to the municipality of tax_  
| _abatement agreements entered into under Section 311.0125 with the_  
| _owners of real property located in the zone if:_

| _of the median family income in the zone, adjusted for family size;_  
| _and_  
|  _(2)_ _____pay to a qualified for-profit entity or a_  
| _nonprofit entity for the purpose of developing, constructing, or_  
| _preserving affordable housing in the zone and in the area adjacent_  
| _to the zone for families that have a yearly income at or below 60_  
| _percent of the area median family income, adjusted for family size._  
|  _(g)_ _____Section 311.0125(b) does not apply to a tax abatement_  
| _agreement described by Subsection (f)(1)._  
|  _(h)_ _____Notwithstanding any other law, a project or_  
| _reinvestment zone financing plan for a reinvestment zone that is_  
| _approved or amended on or after September 1, 2019, shall provide_  
| _that when money is spent from the tax increment fund for the zone_  
| _for the purpose of making infrastructure improvements in the zone,_  
| _a proportionate amount of money in the fund equal to not more than_  
| _20 percent of that amount must be spent from the fund to provide_  
| _necessary infrastructure improvements in the area adjacent to the_  
| _zone. The plan shall provide that the governing body of the_  
| _municipality that designated the zone determines:_  
|  _(1)_ _____the proportionate amount to be spent in the area_  
| _adjacent to the zone, subject to the limitation provided by this_  
| _subsection; and_

| _and located in a reinvestment zone or in the area adjacent to the_  
| _zone, the chief appraiser for the appraisal district in which the_  
| _property is located may exclude from consideration the value of new_  
| _or substantially remodeled residential properties that are located_  
| _in the same neighborhood as the residence homestead being appraised_  
| _and that would otherwise be considered in appraising the residence_  
| _homestead._  
|  _(j)_ _____If the municipality that designated the reinvestment_  
| _zone has adopted minimum habitability standards for residential_  
| _housing units in the municipality, the municipality shall develop_  
| _and adopt a plan to provide for the relocation of tenants displaced_  
| _as a result of the enforcement of those standards. The plan must_  
| _provide that the municipality may use any penalties received from_  
| _the owner of the housing unit from which tenants were displaced to_  
| _pay the tenant's relocation costs._  
|  SECTION 4. Section 311.016, Tax Code, is amended by adding  
| Subsection (c) to read as follows:

| _specific to each neighborhood located in the zone:_  
|  _(1)_ _____a detailed explanation of each expenditure from_  
| _the tax increment fund established by the zone for affordable_  
| _housing in the neighborhood; and_  
|  _(2) an analysis of:_  
|  _(A)_ _____the effect of each expenditure from the fund_  
| _on the availability of affordable housing in the neighborhood; and_

| _Succeeds Act (20 U.S.C. Section 6301 et seq.) to be administered_

|  ~~instruments in English I and English II must be permitted to occur~~  
|  ~~at an earlier date~~ ].  
|  _(r)_ _____Notwithstanding any provision of this section or other_  
| _law, if changes made to the Every Student Succeeds Act (20 U.S.C._  
| _Section 6301 et seq.) reduce the number or frequency of assessment_

| _Board of Education shall adopt rules reducing the number or_  
| _frequency of assessment instruments administered to students under_  
| _state law, and the commissioner shall ensure that students are not_  
| _assessed in subject areas or in grades that are no longer required_

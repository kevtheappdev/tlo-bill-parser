|  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  
|  AN ACT  
| relating to the eligibility of a first responder for workers'  
| compensation benefits for mental trauma injuries, including  
| post-traumatic stress disorder.  
|  BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  
|  SECTION 1. Section 504.019(b), Labor Code, is amended to  
| read as follows:  
|  (b) _It is presumed that post-traumatic_ [ ~~Post-traumatic~~ ]  
| stress disorder suffered by a first responder is a compensable  
| injury under this subtitle _unless it is shown by a preponderance of_  
| _the evidence_ [ ~~only if it is based on a diagnosis~~ ] that:  
|  (1) the disorder is caused by an event occurring  
| _outside_ [ ~~in~~ ] the course and scope of the first responder's  
| employment; _or_ [ ~~and~~ ]  
|  (2) _no_ [ ~~the preponderance of the evidence indicates~~  
|  ~~that the~~ ] event _that occurred in the course and scope of the first_  
| _responder's employment_ was a substantial contributing factor of the  
| disorder.  
|  SECTION 2. The change in law made by this Act applies only  
| to a claim for workers' compensation benefits based on a  
| compensable injury that occurs on or after the effective date of  
| this Act. A claim based on a compensable injury that occurs before  
| that date is governed by the law as it existed on the date the  
| compensable injury occurred, and the former law is continued in  
| effect for that purpose.  
|  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2019.

|  _(m)_ [ ~~(l)~~ ] If the commission requires financial  
| assurance as a condition of a permit or registration under

| _The commission may adopt rules for issuing duplicate and multiple_  
| _insignia._  
|  _(g-2)_ _____The commission shall require a transporter to submit_  
| _an annual report on the records maintained by the transporter to the_

| _under this subsection is not eligible to receive the annual_  
| _registration insignia and is subject to revocation of the_

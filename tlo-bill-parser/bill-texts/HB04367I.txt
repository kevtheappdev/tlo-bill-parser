| follows:  
|  (e) A person who qualifies for an exemption under Section  
| 11.131 _or 11.138_ after January 1 of a tax year may receive the  
| exemption for the applicable portion of that tax year immediately  
| on qualification for the exemption.  
|  SECTION 3. Section 11.43(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) An exemption provided by Section 11.13, 11.131, 11.132,  
| 11.133, 11.134, _11.138,_ 11.17, 11.18, 11.182, 11.1827, 11.183,

| Subsection (r), the chief appraiser may require a person allowed  
| one of the exemptions in a prior year to file a new application to  
| confirm the person's current qualification for the exemption by  
| delivering a written notice that a new application is required,  
| accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person  
| previously allowed the exemption. If the person previously allowed  
| the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief appraiser may  
| not cancel the exemption due to the person's failure to file the new  
| application unless the chief appraiser complies with the  
| requirements of Subsection (q), if applicable.  
|  SECTION 4. Section 11.431(a), Tax Code, is amended to read  
| as follows:  
|  (a) The chief appraiser shall accept and approve or deny an  
| application for a residence homestead exemption, including an  
| exemption under Section 11.131 or 11.132 for the residence  
| homestead of a disabled veteran or the surviving spouse of a  
| disabled veteran, an exemption under Section 11.133 for the  
| residence homestead of the surviving spouse of a member of the armed  
| services of the United States who is killed in action, [ ~~or~~ ] an  
| exemption under Section 11.134 for the residence homestead of the  
| surviving spouse of a first responder who is killed or fatally  
| injured in the line of duty, _or an exemption under Section 11.138_  
| _for the residence homestead of a qualifying disabled first_  
| _responder or the surviving spouse of a qualifying disabled first_  
| _responder,_ after the deadline for filing it has passed if it is  
| filed not later than two years after the delinquency date for the  
| taxes on the homestead.  
|  SECTION 5. Section 26.10(c), Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  (c) If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead  
| exemption under Section 11.131 _or 11.138_ applicable to a property  
| on January 1 of a year terminated during the year, the tax due  
| against the residence homestead is calculated by multiplying the  
| amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the residence  
| homestead for the entire year had the individual not qualified for  
| the _residence homestead_ exemption [ ~~under Section 11.131~~ ] during the  
| year by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the  
| numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the date  
| the exemption terminated.  
|  SECTION 6. Section 26.1125, Tax Code, is amended to read as  
| follows:  
|  Sec. 26.1125. CALCULATION OF TAXES ON RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD  
| OF 100 PERCENT OR TOTALLY DISABLED VETERAN _OR QUALIFYING DISABLED_  
| _FIRST RESPONDER_. (a)  If a person qualifies for an exemption under  
| Section 11.131 _or 11.138_ after the beginning of a tax year, the  
| amount of the taxes on the residence homestead of the person for the  
| tax year is calculated by multiplying the amount of the taxes that  
| otherwise would be imposed on the residence homestead for the  
| entire year had the person not qualified for the _applicable_  
| exemption [ ~~under Section 11.131~~ ] by a fraction, the denominator of  
| which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days that  
| elapsed before the date the person qualified for the _applicable_  
| exemption [ ~~under Section 11.131~~ ].  
|  (b) If a person qualifies for an exemption under Section  
| 11.131 _or 11.138_ with respect to the property after the amount of  
| the tax due on the property is calculated and the effect of the  
| qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the  
| property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall recalculate the  
| amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll.  If  
| the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been  
| paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in  
| whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the person's  
| authorized agent.  If the tax on the property has been paid, the tax  
| collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the person who paid  
| the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.  
|  SECTION 7. Section 403.302(d-1), Government Code, is  
| amended to read as follows:  
|  (d-1) For purposes of Subsection (d), a residence homestead  
| that receives an exemption under Section 11.131, 11.133, [ ~~or~~ ]

| study is not considered to be taxable property.  
|  SECTION 8. Section 11.138, Tax Code, as added by this Act,  
| applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed for a tax year beginning on  
| or after January 1, 2020.  
|  SECTION 9. This Act takes effect January 1, 2020, but only  
| if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 86th Legislature,  
| Regular Session, 2019, authorizing the legislature to provide for  
| an exemption from ad valorem taxation of all or part of the market  
| value of the residence homesteads of certain disabled first  
| responders and their surviving spouses is approved by the voters.  
| If that constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters,  
| this Act has no effect.
